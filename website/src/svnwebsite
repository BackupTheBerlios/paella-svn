How this website is made
------------------------------------

I am writing this to hopefully help a person who has a project on
|berlios| to easily put a website together and maintain it.

I am not a web site developer, so putting a website together takes 
a little more inertia for me.  I decided to use subversion to help maintain
my website.  I use docutils_ to create the pages.

From here on out, I am going to assume that you are developer with
a project on http://developer.berlios.de .  To make the writing of this easier,
you will have to assume your berlios account is "username" and your project is
"projectname".  Finally it will be assumed that you have a typical repository layout
where creating a toplevel directory would not present a problem.

To start off with:

create the toplevel directory::

       svn mkdir svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/projectname/website
       
I also made a source directory::

       svn mkdir svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/projectname/website/src

and check it out::

    svn co svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/projectname/website

The website directory is intended to be the root of the website.  You can start
editing files and adding them to the repository.  I use reStructuredText formatted
text files to create these pages in src.  You can see the sources for these pages
at http://paella.berlios.de/src/ .

This website is also sharing documentation with the paella source.  In my source 
tree there is a docs directory with more reStructuredText files.  I share these with
the website by making an empty docs directory in the /website/src directory.  Add
this directory to the repository, and keep it empty.  Then cd into the website/src/docs 
directory and svn switch svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/projectname/trunk/docs,
or whereever you want to share your docs.

I have a simple script to build the site in the webroot, 
http://paella.berlios.de/build-website .  I add the new files that are built to the
repository and commit them.  I then export the website using a small one-liner, which
can be found here, http://paella.berlios.de/export-website .

ssh shell.berlios.de svn export --force svn://svn.berlios.de/projectname/website /home/groups/projectname/htdocs
