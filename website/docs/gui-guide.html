<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The management interface was developed to be a convenient way to
access and manipulate objects in the database.  The interface is not
entirely intuitive and diverges from the way most interfaces both look
and behave.  This was done, not to confuse the user, but to get something
up and running quickly.  Graphical user interfaces can take a long time to
develop, as the developer has to write a lot of supporting code to go along
with the widgets.  This can be quite time consuming, and keeps the developer
from being able to concentrate on some of the more functional aspects of the
interface.  This means that the gui is lacking in buttons, icons, tooltips, and
standard menu entries.  This does not mean that the gui is unable to be used,
but it will take some time to get used to how things work.</p>
<p>It has been my desire to get as much functionality up and running before
getting the interface to conform to more conventional standards.  At the
moment, most of the necessary functionality is present, and only the less
used (or presumably less used) parts are unimplemented.  Notably the
import and export routines for the individual components aren't implemented
yet.  To compensate, there are command line tools to handle this; paella-import
and paella-export.  Importing and exporting a complete database is supported
in the gui, although the progress bars on the status dialogs aren't very
accurate.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-ideas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Common Ideas</a></h2>
<p>Many of the widgets in the paella-management application are in the form of
a split view, with a list on the lefthand side, and an html view on the righthand
side.  Selecting an item on the lefthand side will display a view of that item on
the righthand side.  Many of the actions that can be performed to the objects
being managed by these widgets can be done by clicking on links in the html
view.</p>
<p>Also, when you need to edit the variables on many of the objects, an external
text editor will be spawned and the variables will be displayed in the form of a
config file that is used by the python ConfigParser module.  When this is done,
all of the sections of the config file will be traits and the options will be then names
of the variables.  The values can have tags in them as if they were miniature
templates. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[some_trait]
my_url:      http://&lt;--|another_trait:hostname|--&gt;.&lt;--|another_trait:domain|--&gt;/
</pre>
<p>This allows you to create variables that are composed of other variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paella-main-menu-window">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Paella Main Menu Window</a></h1>
<img alt="images/main_menu_widget.png" src="images/main_menu_widget.png" />
<p>The main menu window is a small window that is used to access the other widgets in
the manager.  The main view is a list view that lists some of the available  widgets.
Simply selecting one of the list items will open up one of the widgets, unless the item
has child items.  The list items that have children are differs, environ, and suites.
The rest of the widgets can be opened with the menubar at the top of the window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-menu">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Main Menu</a></h1>
<p>I will begin by discussing the widgets that can be accessed from the &quot;Main&quot; menu
on the top menu bar.</p>
<div class="section" id="manage-apt-sources">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Manage Apt Sources</a></h2>
<img alt="images/apt_sources_widget.png" src="images/apt_sources_widget.png" />
<p>This widget will let you add new apt sources to the database, to be used
in the suites.  To add a new apt source, select an apt source from the
list on the left, and press the &quot;New&quot; button on the toolbar.  The dialog
will contain the values of the apt source that you selected.  Modify the
text entries as you need for the new apt source.  You will be able to
use this new apt source when you make a new suite.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no ability to update the apt sources, remove
apt sources, or to change the apt sources for a suite.  Some of this
functionality is planned for the future, but at a moderate to low priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-suite-manager">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Open Suite Manager</a></h2>
<img alt="images/suite_manager_widget.png" src="images/suite_manager_widget.png" />
<p>This widget will allow you to make new suites.  Use the new button on the
toolbar to create a new suite.  A dialog window will appear, where the name
of the new suite should be placed.  Once the name is set, another dialog will
appear that will let you select the apt sources for that suite.  The apt sources
are listed by name in the dialog, and the order of the selected apt sources will
be the order that they will appear in the /etc/apt/sources.list file on installed
systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manage-apt-keys">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Manage Apt Keys</a></h2>
<p>This widget is a new widget to help manage gpg keys that are used to sign the
debian archives.  At the moment, the only function is to add a new key to the
database, and this must be done by copying, and pasting the gpg public key
into a dialog window.  There is no functionality for modifying or removing keys.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you should use the command line programs, paella-import
and paella-export to handle the apt keys at this time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database-menu">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Database Menu</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="connect-disconnect-to-from-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Connect/Disconnect to/from database</a></h2>
<p>Selecting connect to a database will connect you to the paella database.  A
dialog will appear where you can fill out the information required to connect.
The dialog will be pre-filled with values from the ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  If any of these environment variables are set, they will be used
instead of the values entered into the dialog box.  You also won't be notified
that this has occurred.  The variables are 'PAELLA_DBHOST', 'PAELLA_DBNAME',
'PAELLA_DBPORT', and 'PAELLA_DBUSER'.  In the future, if these environment
variables are set, the dialog will display those values and refuse to let them
be modified.  Normally, you should use the ~/.paellarc file to store the
database connection info, and not use the environment variables in the
shell that you run paella-management from.</p>
<p>Disconnecting from the database will do that, and it will close all the open widgets
that are using the database connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-export-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Import/Export Database</a></h2>
<p>These two menu entries will allow you to import and export the database that you
are working on.  Selecting either of these will create a directory selection dialog
window, where you can choose the directory that you want to import from or export
to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widgets-accessed-from-the-list-view">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Widgets accessed from the list view</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="differs">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Differs</a></h2>
<p>This item has children and doesn't open a widget.  Currently, the
only available differs are for families and traits.</p>
<p>The differ program that's used and tested is xxdiff.  It is probably possible
to use another graphical differ program.  This can be set in the ~/.paellarc
config file.  The database will be updated with both the left and right side,
depending on if they've been changed or not.  In order for the graphical
differ to work with paella, it must be able to save the left and/or right file
under the same filename that it was given as arguments.</p>
<p>In each of the differs, the button that performs the the leftmost button
on the toolbar (and it can use a more appropriate icon).</p>
<div class="section" id="family-differ">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Family Differ</a></h3>
<p>The family differ will let you &quot;diff&quot; the variables from two different
families.  Each family's variables are presented as a text file that's
similar to a config file used by the python ConfigParser module.
Each of the sections in this file correspond to traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trait-differ">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Trait Differ</a></h3>
<img alt="images/trait_differ_widget.png" src="images/trait_differ_widget.png" />
<p>The trait differ will let you diff either scripts or templates from any trait
in any suite.  You will be presented two list views with combo boxes right
below them.  The update buttons on the bottom will update the corresponding
list view with the selections from the combo boxes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environ">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Environ</a></h2>
<img alt="images/default_environment_widget.png" src="images/default_environment_widget.png" />
<p>This item has children and doesn't open a widget.  There are two
environments that can be edited, the current environment, and the
default environment.  The widgets simply display the rows in the
database table, but when you need to edit the environment, the
external editor will present the table in the form of a config file.</p>
<p>The import and export options are functional in both environment
editors.  They correspond to the standard open and save actions
that are found on most standard guis.  The file format for import
and export is that of a config file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="suites">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Suites</a></h2>
<p>This item has children and doesn't open a widget.  The children to this item are
the names of suites and selecting one of them will open up a trait manager
widget for that suite.</p>
<div class="section" id="trait-manager">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Trait Manager</a></h3>
<img alt="images/traits_widget.png" src="images/traits_widget.png" />
<p>The trait manager is one of the widgets that will be used often, as it's the
primary place where most of the important configuring will happen.  The widget
is a split window with a list of traits on the lefthand side and an html view on the
righthand side.  To create a new trait, click the &quot;New&quot; icon on the toolbar and enter
the name of the new trait in the dialog that appears.  When you select a trait from
the list on the lefthand side, the information for the trait will appear in the view on
the righthand side.</p>
<div class="section" id="description">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Description</a></h4>
<p>There are a lot of options in the trait view.  At the top of the view is the name of the
trait.  Just below this are a couple of links for the description of the trait.  Selecting
the &quot;(description)&quot; link will bring up an internal text editor where you can edit the
description of the trait.  Simple html elements are allowed in this description.
Selecting the &quot;(show)&quot; link will display the description right below the top section.
This will cause the &quot;(show)&quot; link to change to &quot;(hide)&quot;, and selecting this link will
then hide the description.  Once you select &quot;(show)&quot;, the description will be shown
for every trait that is selected from the list on the lefthand side, until the &quot;(hide)&quot;
link is clicked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parents">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Parents</a></h4>
<p>Below the description is the parents section.  There is an &quot;edit&quot; link on the right
of the section header.  Selecting the &quot;edit&quot; link will allow you to assign parents
to this trait.  Be careful when selecting the parents, as there are no guards against
creating <a class="reference external" href="problems.html#circular-dependencies">circular</a> dependencies.  Each parent that's listed in the view is a link.
Clicking on one of the parents will bring up a new trait manager widget with that
trait selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packages">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">Packages</a></h4>
<p>Below the parents section is the packages section.  Here you can add and remove
packages, and define actions for them.  On the right side of the packages header
is a &quot;(new)&quot; link.  Selecting this will bring up a dialog where you enter the name of
the package and the action that's to be associated with it.  The default action is to
&quot;install&quot;, but the other other options are &quot;remove&quot;, and &quot;reconfig&quot;.  Any other option
that's entered will be ignored by the installer.  Only one action may be entered at a
time.  The delete link to the right of a package in the list of package will delete the
package, and <em>all</em> of it's associated actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="templates">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">Templates</a></h4>
<p>Below the packages section is the templates section.  The templates section
displays a list of templates to be installed on the target system.  Selecting the
&quot;Templates&quot; link in the section will allow you to add templates to the trait.  When
this link is selected, a file selection dialog will appear.  The file that should be
selected is expected to be a tarball.  This is required, and there is no way just
to select a single file to use as a template.  I may add this functionality later, but
it's a very low priority for me now.  Besides, although it may seem strange, this
method is actually quite useful and timesaving once you really start using paella.
Ordinarily the tarball should be made as root on some system, usually like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tar cv /etc /var/path/to/something/interesting | gzip &gt; myconfig.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Actually, the tarball can contain anything, but the path, ownership, and permissions
for the template are taken from the tarball, although these can be adjusted later if
you can't add templates in this manner.  You don't want to use a tarball from a full
system backup, as it will take a long time to extract the files from it.  If you try to
select a template that's already on the list, the template in the database won't be
replaced.  If you wish to do this you must either delete or rename the template in
the database.</p>
<p>Each column in the list of templates is a link.  The first column is the name of the
template.  This is the path of the template, relative to / on the target system.  Clicking
on this link will bring up the internal template editor.  The internal template editor is
useful for making tags for the template.  To make a tag, select some text and right
click the selection, then a context menu will appear.  You can then replace the selected
text with a previously defined variable in the context menu, or create a new variable.
If you decide to create a new variable, the selected text will appear as the value for
that variable.  You will need to save the template by clicking the &quot;save&quot; button on the
toolbar, in order to save your changes.  The status bar on the bottom of the editor
will let you know if the template has changed, or if it's been saved.</p>
<p>The second column in the list of templates displays the owner, group, and permissions
for the template.  Clicking on this link will allow you to change these values, as well as
change the name of the template.  This is useful if you used a tarball that wasn't made
from backing up part of a system, or if you need to replace a template in the database
with a newer one.  If you do this, you can use the trait differ to adjust the differences.</p>
<p>The third column in the list of templates are the &quot;(edit)&quot; and &quot;(delete)&quot; links.  Clicking
on the &quot;(edit)&quot; link will spawn the external editor, and you can use the editor of your
choice to edit the template.  The external editor is set in the ~/.paellarc file as the
text_editor option in the management_gui section.  The <strong>EDITOR</strong> environment
variable will override this option.  The <strong>VISUAL</strong> variable isn't used.  The &quot;(delete)&quot;
link will allow you to delete the template from the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variables">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">Variables</a></h4>
<p>Below the templates is the variables section.  Clicking on the &quot;Variables&quot; link in the
section header will bring up the variable editor widget.  This is a very simple widget,
and not fully functional.  You can only add and edit variables here, and not delete
them.  In the future this widget will probably be replaced by using an external editor
with the variables displayed in the form of a config file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scripts">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">Scripts</a></h4>
<p>Below the variables section is the scripts section.  There is a &quot;new&quot; link on the right
side of the section header.  Clicking this link will allow you to add a new script to the
trait.  A dialog will appear, where you can select the name of the script.  The names
correspond to steps in the trait's install process.  Selecting a name such as &quot;install&quot;
or &quot;templates&quot; will override the default action of the trait.  For example, if there are
templates in the trait, and you create a &quot;templates&quot; script, those templates will not
be installed unless the script specifically does this.</p>
<p>There are three columns in the list of traits and each column is a link.  The name of
the script is in the first column.  Clicking on the name of the trait will display a
window showing the contents of the script.  You can't edit the script with this window.
The second column is the &quot;(edit)&quot; link, and clicking on this will spawn the external
editor and allow you to edit the script.  The last column is the &quot;(delete)&quot; link, and
clicking on this will delete the script.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profiles">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Profiles</a></h2>
<img alt="images/profiles_widget.png" src="images/profiles_widget.png" />
<p>The profile manager is a widget to help manage the profiles in the database.  The
widget is a split window with a list of profiles on the lefthand side and an html
view on the righthand side.  To create a new profile, select the &quot;New&quot; action from
the toolbar.  All new profiles will be based on the &quot;skeleton&quot; profile.  The skeleton
profile can be configured in the ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p>When a profile is selected, information about the profile is presented on the right
hand side of the window, in an html view.  At the top of the html view, the name of
the profile is displayed, along with the suite it belongs to.  Clicking on the suite will
display a dialog where you can change the suite that the profile belongs to.  Be
careful that all the traits listed in the profile are in the suite that you select, or the
profile won't be able to be installed.  At the moment, the application doesn't check
to make sure that the traits listed in the profile are in the suite, but this is planned
to be fixed in the future.</p>
<p>You can click the &quot;Traits&quot; link to adjust the list of traits to be installed in the profile.
It is not necesary to list every trait, since the parents of the traits that are listed will
also be installed with the profile.  The installer will attempt to install the traits in the
order that they are listed in, unless a parent trait is listed after its child.  In that case
the parent will be installed before the child.</p>
<p>You can click on the &quot;Variables&quot; link to add, remove, and alter variables for the profile.
Clicking on this will spawn the external text editor, and the form will be as a config
file, where all of the sections are traits.</p>
<p>You can click on the &quot;Families&quot; link to add or remove families from the profile.  The
families won't be applied in any specific order, but parent families will be applied
before the child families.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the html view is a delete link that you can use to delete the profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="families">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Families</a></h2>
<img alt="images/families_widget.png" src="images/families_widget.png" />
<p>The families manager is a simple widget to help manage the
families in the database.  You can create a new family by selecting
&quot;New&quot; from the menu or toolbar.  To manage a family, you can select
one from the list on the left side of the widget.</p>
<p>When a family is selected from the list, an html interface to the family
will be presented on the right side.  At the bottom of the page is a
&quot;delete&quot; link, which will let you delete the family.  There are two more
links on this page, on table headers.  The &quot;Parents&quot; link will let you
assign parents to this family.  The &quot;Variables&quot; link will let you edit
the variables for the family.</p>
<p>Editing the variables is done in an external editor, and it uses
a config file format, where all the sections are traits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="machines">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Machines</a></h2>
<p>The machine management widget is actually three different widgets in a single
&quot;shell&quot;.  The objects that will be managed can be selected by clicking on one of
the icons on the toolbar, or by selecting it from the menu.  The &quot;New&quot; icon on the
toolbar is used to add a new object, the type of which will depend on the manager
that's currently being used.  With this widget, you can manage machines,
diskconfigs, and kernels.</p>
<div class="section" id="manage-machines">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Manage Machines</a></h3>
<img alt="images/machines_widget.png" src="images/machines_widget.png" />
<p>The machine manager is a split window with a list of machines on the lefthand
side and an html view on the righthand side.  You can create a new machine by
clicking on the &quot;New&quot; icon on the toolbar at the top. Selecting a machine from the
list will display information about the machine in the view.  There are a lot of options
that can be set for the machine.</p>
<div class="section" id="parent">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id32">Parent</a></h4>
<p>At the top, just below the name of the machine is where the parent for the machine
is set.  Unlike traits and families, a machine can only have one parent.  Here you can
either select a parent by clicking on the &quot;select&quot; link, or delete a parent from clicking
on the &quot;delete&quot; link.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attributes">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">Attributes</a></h4>
<p>Right below the table that displays the parent is the table that holds the main
attributes of the machine.  These attributes are kernel, profile, and diskconfig.  If any
of these attributes aren't set, the corresponding attribute of the parent will be used.
If you click on one of the links for the attribute in the leftmost column, a dialog will
appear where you can enter in the attribute.  The value column will display the value
for the attribute.  If an attribute is not set for the machine, the value will be obtained
from the closest parent machine.  The &quot;Inherited From&quot; column will display the name
of the machine where the attribute is set.  If the attribute is set for the machine you're
manipulating, the column will display &quot;(set here)&quot;, and in the &quot;Command&quot; column, a
link will be present allowing you to clear the value.  If an attribute is not set in the
machine you're managing, or anywhere in its ancestry, you will see a warning displayed
in the value and &quot;Inherited From&quot; columns.  This is a warning, as the machine will
probably fail to be installed if these attributes aren't set anywhere, but it's possible to
install a machine if these are unset by having scripts set for the machine that manage
installing the kernel, diskconfig, or profile, instead of relying on the default behaviour
of paella.  The machine name links in the &quot;Inherited From&quot; column are meant to open
an new machine manager with that machine selected, in a manner similar to selecting
parent traits in the trait manager.  This is not implemented yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">Families</a></h4>
<p>Below the attributes table is the section for families.  You can add a new family to the
machine by clicking the &quot;new&quot; link in the &quot;Families&quot; header on the right.  A dialog will
appear where you can enter the name of a family to add to the machine.  In the table
of familie, each row has an &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; link.  Clicking on the edit link will do
nothing but display a dialog that this operation is not supported yet.  Clicking on the
delete link will remove the family from the machine.  In the future, the families will be
assigned in a manner similar to how they are assigned to the profiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id35">Scripts</a></h4>
<p>Just below the Families section is the Scripts section.  You can add a new script by
selecting the &quot;new&quot; link on the right side of the section header.  The names of the
scripts correspond to steps in the machine installer process.  The table of scripts
will show the scripts that will be run by the machine installer, and the machine that
the script is inherited from.  A script that is set for the machine will have &quot;(defined
here)&quot; in the inherited column, and there will be &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; links in the
command column on the right side of the table.  Clicking on the edit link will spawn an
external editor where you can edit the script.  Clicking on the delete link will delete
the script from the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">Variables</a></h4>
<p>Below the Scripts section is the Variables section.  Here you can set variables for the
machine.  You can click on the &quot;new&quot; link to add a new variable.  This will display a
dialog where you can enter the trait, name and value for the variable.  In the table of
variables, in the command column exist &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; links.  You can click on the
delete link to remove a variable from a machine.  Clicking on the edit link will spawn
an external editor where you can edit the variables.  The form of the file in the editor
will be a config file where the sections correspond to traits.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="manage-disk-configs">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id37">Manage Disk Configs</a></h3>
<img alt="images/diskconfig_widget.png" src="images/diskconfig_widget.png" />
<p>The diskconfig manager is a split window with a list of diskconfigs on the lefthand
side and an html view on the righthand side.  You can create a new diskconfig by
clicking on the &quot;New&quot; icon on the toolbar at the top.  Selecting a diskconfig from the
list will display the diskconfig in the view on the right.</p>
<p>There are two links in the diskconfig view, &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;.  You can click on the
delete link to delete the diskconfig.  Clicking on the edit link will spawn an external
editor, where you can edit the diskconfig.</p>
<p>The diskconfig manager is a very new widget.  This functionality was &quot;shoe-horned&quot;
into the database, and while it's fully functional, it's still bare and basic.  I have not
made too many plans on how to make better use of this yet, but I've decided that
just having bare simple text files is insufficient.  It's possible that the templates
could be made out of the diskconfigs, but the variables for the template tags won't
be coming from the traits.  It's also possible that I may create new tables that can
be used to generate a diskconfig.  I'm still up in the air on exactly which direction I
want to take with how this will be implemented.  I do plan to always support a basic
hardcoded diskconfig, but it would be nice to have a more flexible method of making
diskconfigs.</p>
