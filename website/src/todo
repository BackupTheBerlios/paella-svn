todo list:
--------------------

This items on this list are mostly complete now.  For a better synopsis of 
what's going to be done with paella, please look at the plans_ page.

---------------------------------
general todo
---------------------------------

+ use cheetah templates

  - started

  - all cheetah templates will have ##cheetah on the first line

  - progress has stalled here, and using python scripts to help modify 
    important config files seems to work just as well.

+ fix problems encountered with importing Packages files into the database

  - **done** there is a workaround that seems to be working for now 

  - **N/A** start using debian-python package and deprecate my debian code 

  - stop using package tables altogether

+ consider using bcfg2 for live updating of already installed machines

  - maybe also consider puppet

+ **done** completely deprecate the gtk management client
	----done, the kde manager does most of what gtk manager did

+ clean up unused options from paellarc file, look for options to move into default 
  environment in database. **mostly done**

+ modify default environment to use multiple "installer" sections and be able to 
  assign a machine to use a particular section.  The "installer" section will stay and 
  be the default.  This will allow each machine to use it's own installer environment, 
  so that one machine can be installed with aptitude, while another can be installed 
  with apt-get, among other possibilities.

+ Think about making a "common" suite where the more abstract code and templates 
  can be stored and used, without having to duplicate things from suite to suite.  This will 
  likely be difficult and time consuming, but might create a more easily maintained 
  install system.
