<h1>A brief history on my experience with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">fai</a> and the birth of <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de">paella</a>.</h1>
<p>I first looked at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">fai</a> back when potato was stable.  I had just moved
all of the machines on a network to debian, and I was looking for an
easy way to quickly install systems.  After looking it over, I decided not
to use it due to not having enough time to devote to setting everything
up.  There are many steps required to setup a network to be capable
of fully automatic installation.  Making default system configurations
and testing them can take quite a bit of time too.  Any sort of system
that performs network functions like fai or paella can take
more time to setup and configure than doing a quick install/restore.</p>
<p>I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">fai</a> later on when I had time and reason to do so.  By this
time woody was the stable release.  Before too long, I had a system up
and running.  I started by modifying the sample configuration and testing
the system.  Soon, the whole network was installed with fai.  Knowing that
I would be using a system like this for a long term to manage system/network
configurations, I started concentrating on developing default configurations.</p>
<p>During this time, I started using subversion for revision control.  I didn't feel
like keeping a cvs repository for my systems.  I also don't care much for perl,
and prefer python.  So paella was born from wanting to extend fai without having
to dig into perl.  Paella started as a set of &quot;hook&quot; scripts in fai that connected to
a postgresql database to get its configuration.  It eventually grew into it's own
system, and now only (optionally) uses the setup_hardisks script from fai.  The
setup_hardisks script is generally more reliable than the code I made to setup
hardrives.  Most of my concentration on paella has been on the logical system
configuration and network integration.</p>

<h1>Differences between <a class="reference external" href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de">Paella</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Development Environment</p>
<p>First of all, paella is written in python, with a little bash.  Fai is written
with perl and bash.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Configuration Storage</p>
<p>Fai uses an exported nfs filesystem to read configuration data from.  Paella
uses a postgresql database to read/write configuration data.  The tables
are generally read only for the installer user, with the exception of a couple
tables reserved just for the installer to write to.</p>
<p>The use of a sql database has both advantages and disadvantages, when
compared to a file based configuration system.  Obviously it is easier on the
surface to modify a file based configurations system.  Scripts and files are much
easier to manage in a filesystem, rather than in a database.  On the other hand,
small data values and relationships are easier to track and modify in a database.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Configuration Design</p>
<p>Paella is concentrated around system design.  Paella tries to make a
distinction between logical and physical systems.  This distinction allows an
administrator to update/change the hardware of a particular system without
having to mess with the logical part of the system at all.  While this is possible
in fai, it can be difficult to manange.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Installer Design</p>
<p>A consequence of the configuration design allows the distinction in the design
of the installer to be noted.  There are two main types of installers in paella.
There is a chroot installer and a machine installer.  The chroot installer is designed
to install a logical system (profile) to a target directory.  The machine installer is
responsible to preparing a target directory on a physical system (machine_type).
The machine installer then uses the chroot installer to install to the target directory
of the machine.</p>
<p>This separation makes it easier to do interesting things like install a fully configured
diskless system on a server.  You could also mount a loopback filesystem and
specify it to be the target directory for creating live cd's or embedded systems.</p>
