<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>This guide is unfinished.  If you are reading this, do not expect the guide to be correct or
accurate.  This guide has been a work in progress, and has been changing with respect to
things that have been changing in paella, and its dependencies.  This guide should not be
considered to be complete, until this paragraph is removed.  However, much of this guide,
and the scripts and configuration that surround it, are almost complete.  This means that
this guide can be considered as &quot;beta&quot; instead of &quot;alpha&quot;.  While there may be parts of this
guide that are incorrect, I believe that most of this guide can be followed without any
unexpected surprises.  This guide should not be considered as 100% complete until this
paragraph is removed.  This will probably happen soon after lenny is released.</p>

<!-- introductory comment -->
<p>Paella depends on a particular type of setup to operate.  This document details how to
bootstrap that setup, starting from the bare minimum requirements.  This guide is written
with the goal of minimizing the requirement for the root account to setup the system.  The
former method of working with paella, required (possibly) extensive configuring of a local
network.  In order to effectively use paella in a &quot;production&quot; environment, where you are
actually installing machines, still requires the same type of network configuration.  It is hoped
that the method outlined here can help prepare this by using paella to generate the
configuration that paella requires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Requirements</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="debian">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Debian</a></h2>
<p>You should be running debian to follow this quickstart procedure.  It's technically not
required, but this document will assume that your running either lenny, sid, or etch
with VirtualBox running (from backports.org or similar).  This procedure has been tested
while running sid, although lenny should work just fine.  There also shouldn't really be
any problem with using etch, save for having to have VirtualBox installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Hardware</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart routine was developed and tested using a laptop with 3GB of memory.
You could probably get by with less which I will try to estimate later.  Most of the memory
is required to run the virtual machines.  I estimate that only 2GB of ram will be required.
Please note that this is only the hardware requirements for following this quickstart
procedure, and doesn't reflect the actual requirements to run paella in a regular
environment with a network of machines.</p>
<p>You will need to run an operating system that can host VirtualBox OSE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualbox-ose">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">VirtualBox OSE</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart will use VirtualBox OSE to setup the machine that will act as the main
paella server, and also to test to make machines to test the installs.  The procedure outlined
below is assuming that you are using a GNU/Linux system as a host for VirtualBox OSE, but
there shouldn't be anything stopping somebody from using VirtualBox  on another host OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="networking">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Networking</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart has been written to use 10.0.1.0 for the internal network that the virtual
machines will be using.  The main virtual machine (paella.lapnet) will be using the 10.0.1.1
ip, while the other virtual machines will be obtaining their ip's from the dhcp server running
on paella.lapnet.  It is desirable to keep these defaults if at all possible.  If these ip numbers
conflict with your setup, I have tried to make it as easy as possible to use another block of
ip's.  If you can't use the 10.0.1.0 network, I recommend that you still use some block inside
the 10.0.x.0 network.  I have tested the quickstart while changing the network to 10.0.x.0, and
it appears to work without problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-netinst-cd-image-lenny">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Debian Netinst CD Image (Lenny)</a></h2>
<p>The stable (lenny) release is what is currently supported.  You should get the netinst iso,
which available on this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">page</a>.  I used the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-500-i386-netinst.iso">i386</a> image.  Hopefully any architecture should work,
but at the moment, only i386 is tested.  When I'm satisfied that the i386 is working properly, I'll
be testing the amd64 architecture.  Feedback on any other architectures would be appreciated.
If you are using a virtualbox version less than 2, you will have to use the i386 image, as the guest
machines will only run i386 code.  The virtualbox-ose package that ships with debian lenny is
version 1.6.6, which will require using i386 guests.  There are newer virtualbox-ose packages
available at <a class="reference external" href="http://backports.org">http://backports.org</a> that will run amd64 code on the guests, if you wish to use
those.  This quickstart should work with any version from 1.6.6 and above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remaster-the-netinst-iso">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Remaster the netinst iso</a></h2>
<p>This step is highly recommended.  This step is technically optional, but it may be handy,
especially if you have an application that can remaster an iso image.  This allows you to
preseed the debian installer and make an automated install.  Even though this step is
technically optional, it would be a very good idea to get the script below, and the files that
are obtained through subversion in the script to get an idea of how to proceed manually
without performing this step.</p>
<p>If you are running debian, remastering the iso is easy:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir remaster-netinst
cd remaster-netinst
svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p>if you already grabbed the netinst iso image, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso /path/to/debian-500-i386-netinst.iso
</pre>
<p>if you haven't gotten the netinst iso image yet, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p>The script will attempt to download the netinst iso for lenny, but it may be out of date
when by the time you read this, so you are recommended to download the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd">iso</a> manually.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!!!</strong>  This script uses sudo to perform the loopback mounting of the iso
image.  Be sure to look over the script really good before you execute it.  You may want to
change the ARCH variable near the top of the file (note: only i386 is tested at the moment).
Be sure that you have rsync, sudo, and subversion installed.</p>
<p>The script will give you a chance to review and edit the preseed files before you create the
remastered iso image.  All the files that will be used in the remastered iso image will be
located in the cd/ directory. If you have a local mirror that you want to install from, you should
edit the localmirror.cfg file in the cd/ directory.  When the script is finished, the iso image will be
./paella-netinst.iso .</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  The preseed configuration files, and the setup scripts assume that the locale
is set to en_US.UTF-8 .  If you are using another locale, you really need to modify both the
preseed.cfg file, and the setup-paella-server script.  The postgresql database server will not
run unless your locale is generated, and referenced in the postgresql.conf file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Setup the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<p>You need to get the virtualbox frontend up and running.  The user interface varies between
different versions of virtualbox.  These instructions were written using version 1.6.6, which
is the default version in debian lenny.  To start the virtualbox gui type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
virtualbox
</pre>
<p>Make a new machine using the wizard provided by the virtualbox frontend.  Press next
and name the machine &quot;paella&quot;.  Select &quot;Debian&quot; for the OS type.  Press next.  Set the base
memory size to 256MB.  Press next.  Make a new disk image at the default 8GB size (I chose
dynamically expanding size).  Press finish.</p>
<p>Select paella from the list of machines on the frontend, and click the settings button.  In the
configuration dialog, select CD/DVD-ROM on the left hand side.  Click on the Mount CD/DVD
Drive button at the top.  Select the ISO Image File.  Press the folder on the right to bring up
the Virtual Disk Manager.  Here you want to add the netinst iso that you remastered.  It should
be called paella-netinst-$arch.iso, where $arch is the architecture that either you are running,
or that you selected.  Close the Virtual Disk Manager, and make sure that the iso is selected as
the image file that will be mounted.</p>
<p>Now, select the Network part of the list of the left hand side of the settings dialog.  By default,
the network adapter should be enabled, and set to NAT.  This is what we want.  We also want
to add another network interface to this machine, so select the Adapter 2 tab.  Click the
&quot;Enable Network Adapter&quot; button.  Make sure the &quot;Attached to&quot; selection is set to &quot;Internal
Network&quot;.  You will need to name the network in the field that says &quot;Network Name&quot;.  Any name
should do just fine.  I used &quot;lapnet&quot; (no quotes), since I'm on a laptop.  Remember this name,
since you'll need this for the other machine(s) that you will use paella to install to.</p>
<p>If you are using an newer 64 bit processor that has hardware virtualization support, you may want
to enable this in the general preferences, as the virtual machine will run much faster.</p>
<!-- Boot the paella virtual machine -->
<!-- ================================ -->
<div class="section" id="install-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Install the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>Now you should be ready to boot the virtual machine, and install debian lenny.</p>
<p>Boot the machine by pressing Start (the green arrow) on the virtualbox frontend (make sure
the paella virtual machine is the one that's selected).  When the boot screen appears, select
one of the first two menu options.  Don't bother selecting the second option unless you have
a local debian mirror, and you have modified the preseed files.</p>
<p>If you remastered the netinst iso, the install will proceed automatically.  The setup scripts
will be copied to /usr/local/bin by the debian installer.</p>
<p>If you didn't remaster the netinst file, you can find the preseed files, and the setup scripts
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de/netinst/">netinst</a> directory on the paella website.  You can just install debian in the normal
manner.  You'll need to select the standard, desktop, and database-server tasks.  Look at
the preseed file to see how the default setup is configured.  The hostname, main user, and
the main user's password are all set to &quot;paella&quot; to make it easy to remember.  The paella
user should be added to the src, staff, adm, and sudo groups, but this probably isn't
an absolute necessity.  Set the dhcp3-server to listen to eth1 on the debconf question.</p>
<p>The rest of the instructions will assume that you installed from a remastered iso.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-boot-on-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">First boot on the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>After the debian installer is finished, the virtual machine should reboot .  You should take
this time to disassociate the iso image from the machine in the VirtualBox frontend, else
the iso will boot everytime you boot the virtual machine.  You may also want to save a
snapshot of the virtual machine, in case you have problems with the initial setup script.</p>
<p>When the system boots up for the first time, you will want to want to login to the console.
You can reach the console by pressing the &quot;Host&quot; key and F1 (By default, the &quot;Host&quot; key
is the right &lt;ctrl&gt; key).  You will want to login here, instead of to the X session, because
the script will reconfigure X and restart the display manager.</p>
<p>Once you switch to the local console, you will need to login as paella (password paella).
Here you will run a script that will help configure the server and get it ready for the rest
of this procedure.  The script is located at /usr/local/bin/setup-paella-server .  You may
need to edit the script and set the ip addresses that are set near the top.  The default
internal network that is used is 10.0.1.0/24.  You may need to change this if the ip
values conflict with your local network setup.  I suggest you try to stick to these values
if it's possible, and if it's not possible, to use 10.0.2.0/24, or something similar.</p>
<p>Please note that the script will try to install the guest utils and build the guest modules.
If you are not running virtualbox-ose version 1.6.6, you may need to may want to set
&quot;do_backports&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; in the script.  If the version of virtualbox-ose that you are using
doesn't match the version that's available at backports.org, the guest additions are
unlikely to work.  The guest additions are not absolutely necessary.  They just help
keep the mouse from feeling jerky, and also help configure the size of the screen to
more comfortable resolutions.  The attempt to build and install the guest additions
happens at the very end of the script, so if you have problems with this and using the
backports repository doesn't help, you will have to do without the guest modules.  If
you can't use the guest modules, you may need to use a modified xorg.conf to adjust
the resolution of the screen on the guest machine.  Regardless of whether the guest
additions are installed or not, the script will create an example xorg.conf located at
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.unused .  You may copy this to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and modify it
as you need.  If you do this, you must use a resolution that the vesa driver supports.</p>
<p>When  you are ready you should type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo setup-paella-server
</pre>
<p>This should set up everything that couldn't be done on the debian installer.  This script
will setup the cofiguration of the database, firewall, dhcp server, and the network interface
for the internal network.  Also, the virtualbox guest modules will be installed, and the
xorg.conf configuration will be modified to make use of them.  The script will need to
download about 11 megabytes worth of packages to build the guest modules with
module-assistant.  When the script is finished, you should see a graphical login screen.
You may want to return to the console that you are logged into to logout before logging
into the X session.</p>
<p>Once you have logged into the X session, you may want to load this page on a web
browser in the virtual machine and continue this guide.  This will make it easier to
cut and paste the commands that are given here.  The rest of the guide will assume that
you have done this.</p>

<div class="section" id="make-a-gpg-key">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Make a gpg key</a></h2>
<p>You'll need a gpg key to sign the Release files of the local debian repository.  This is important,
since debian has spent a great deal of time making it possible to verify the authenticity of the
packages being installed on your system.  Full instructions on how to generate a key and use it
properly are beyond the scope of this docuement.  You can find more detailed
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a> .</p>
<p>I have written a script that will help create a key to sign the archives with.  This key will be
created without a passphrase and should only be used with this quickstart guide.</p>
<p>To run the script, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generate-gpg-key
</pre>
<p>If you need more random bytes, try moving the mouse around a lot, and pecking the keyboard
randomly in a text editor.  To get the disk moving, type this in another terminal window:</p>

<div class="section" id="setup-initial-debian-mirror">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Setup initial debian mirror</a></h2>

guide.</p>
<p>To run the script, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
initialize-local-debian-repository
</pre>
<p>The script will call apt-move to install the packages located in /var/cache/apt/archives
into the local repository.  It will then setup reprepro and fill the repository with the rest
of the packages that will be needed to finish this guide.  It will use the gpg key that you
created above to sign the repository, add that key to apt, add the local repository to
/etc/apt/sources.list, and run apt-get update.</p>
<p>Take a break.  Grab some coffee.  This will take a bit, depending on your internet
connection.  I've taken care to only include the packages that needed, plus a few
extra packages that I use as tools to help me test this quickstart routine.  As of the time
this was written, the pool directory was 465MB in size.</p>

<div class="section" id="obtain-paella-from-subversion">

<p>Now you're ready to get the source code from subversion.  To do this, type</p>

</pre>
<p>This will setup the directories, and download the source code from the berlios subversion

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Why Debian Live?</a></h2>
<p>Now you're ready to make the live nfsroot installer.  In the past, I had done this with paella,
and I had a flaky configuration that worked, albeit just barely.  In the beginning, I had to
compile a special kernel to allow me to mount an nfsroot, and have the network drivers
compiled right into the kernel image.  Later, the work on the initrd filesystem allowed me to
use stock kernels to boot from an nfsroot, but the readonly live nfsroot was flaky and limited
at best.  These days, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive">DebianLive</a> to help do much of the dirty work here.  It's even
possible to use DebianLive to make a live iso with the paella installer on it, for machines
that won't boot off of the network.  I actually had to do this with the older livecd package in
the past, but DebianLive is much better.  Now I can leave the management of a good live
system in somebody else's hands, and just concentrate on using that live system as an
installer for paella.</p>
<p>I have written a script that will help build the live netboot image for the installer.  To run
the script , type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
create-debian-live-image
</pre>
<p>This script will copy the live-helper config files to /freespace/live/config and build the
image, then install the image and the tftpboot files to the appropriate locations.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>  If you aren't able to use 10.0.1.1 as the ip address of your eth1 interface
on the virtual machine, you will have to edit /freespace/live/config/binary and set
LH_NET_ROOT_SERVER to the value of the ip that you will be using and then build the image
again.</p>
<p>Here are some quick instructions on how to do that:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd /freespace/live
sudo lh_clean
sudo lh_build
sudo ./config/prepare-netboot
</pre>

<div class="section" id="install-the-admin-package">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Install the Admin Package</a></h2>
<p>Now we're almost ready to use the management interface.  To install it, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install paella-admin
</pre>
<p>The executable is called <strong>paella-management</strong>.  You can either type it into a
terminal, or find it in the debian menu (but not in the kde menu, yet).  Don't run it yet, you
should set up the configuration file first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-paellarc">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Setup ~/.paellarc</a></h2>
<p>The master config file will be found at /etc/paellarc .  The master config file is the one that
the installer will use.  You can copy this file to ~/.paellarc and edit it.  The paella-management
program will read the master config file, then the local one at ~/.paellarc .  The local file will
override options in the master file.  If you are not familiar with the file format, you can read
about it <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html">here</a> .  Options that are prefixed by an underscore are not referenced in the code.
You can make your own underscored options, if you wish, to make it easier to edit.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd
cp /etc/paellarc .paellarc
</pre>
<p>In the database section, the dbhost option should be the ip address of the eth1 interface,
which should be 10.0.1.1 .  You will also need to change the dbusername option to the database
admin user (dbadmin).  The dbusername in the master config file should  always be &quot;paella&quot;.</p>
<p>The management_gui section has options for the paella-management application.  The options
that you may want to change here are &quot;text_editor&quot;, and &quot;x_differ&quot;.  Both of these commands
should display an X window.  For the x_differ, I highly recommend xxdiff.  I have a config file that
makes it easier to use xxdiff, located at /usr/share/doc/paella-admin/xxdiffrc .  You'll want to
copy this file to ~/.xxdiffrc .  The x_differ command line in the paellarc file conforms
to this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x_differ LeftFile RightFile
</pre>
<p>If your differ needs options on the command line, please write a wrapper for it, and use that.</p>
<p>There are only two text editors that I included with this quickstart routine.  They are
kate (the default) and xemacs.  If you wish to use another one, go ahead and install it and
put the command in the ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p>You should not need to change any other options.</p>
<p>The paellarc configuration file is used by two distinct users, the database admin, and the
paella installer.  Much of the configuration in the paellarc file is used for the database admin.
The paella installer user only needs the database section of the paellarc file, as this user
uses the paella database for the rest of his configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-paella-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Start paella-management</a></h2>
<p>Run the paella-management script to start the management interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-management
</pre>
<p>The little window that pops up is the main menu for paella.  From here on, I'll refer it as
the &quot;main paella window&quot;.  There are two menu systems on the &quot;main paella window&quot;.  One
of them is the standard menu bar at the top.  The other one is the list right below the menu
bar.  This is the list that contains &quot;differs, environ, familes, ...&quot;.  This is the part of the
interface that has so far defied any conformance to standards that you might be used to.
I'm going to be calling this part of the interface the &quot;list menu&quot;.</p>
<p>The first thing that you will want to do is to connect to the database.  There is a connect button
on the toolbar for you to press.  The connection dialog entries are taken from your ~/.paellarc
file.  The settings for postgresql in this quickstart don't require a password for dbadmin, but
you'll want to use one if you use paella in a production environment.</p>
<p>Once you connect to the database, you should get a dialog asking to create the primary
tables.  You should click yes here to setup an empty database structure.  If you don't do
this, the database import procedure will create these tables for you, but you won't be able to
use the paella-management interface until you do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-the-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">Import the database</a></h2>
<p>Now we are going to import the startup database.  You may need an internet connection to
import the database.  The importer downloads the Packages files from the debian mirror in
the database.xml file, and inserts them into the database.  Go to the menubar, and in the
database menu, select &quot;import database&quot;.  A directory selection dialog will appear.  On the
VM I tested, this window was a little bit too skinny, so you'll probably need to make it wider
with your mouse.  The database directory will be at:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
~/workspace/paella/config/share/databases/quickstart-vbox/
</pre>
<p>Note that the default debian mirror is  <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian</a> .  If you need to
change this, edit the database.xml file in the quickstart-vbox  directory, and alter the uri
attribute to the aptsource xml element at the top of the file.  You can change this to a local
mirror if you already have one.  I recommend against using the local mirror that you just
created in this quickstart routine, as you would likely want to make new traits with packages
that aren't available in that mirror.  Paella has only been tested with http apt sources, it's
behaviour on other methods is unknown.</p>
<p>If everything is working, you should be seeing an ugly little progress dialog displaying
something resembling what it should be doing.  I need to fix this dialog to make it more
accurate, but at least you'll see it working while it inserts the information into the
database.  The packages will probably take a little while to insert.  The apt_source_packages
table can take a lot of space that could be better saved.  In the future, it will probably default
to only holding package names rather than the other attributes in the Packages file.  The
reason they are there is to help keep the automated installations from bombing due to
unavailable or misspelled packages.  It would also be nice to have a little package browser
to help when creating traits, but that's in the future, and it would need the full record of each
package to be stored in the database.</p>

<div class="section" id="guide-to-paella-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">Guide to Paella Management</a></h2>
<p>A more complete guide to using paella-management can be found <a class="reference external" href="gui-guide.html">here</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="add-the-archive-key">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">Add the archive key</a></h2>
<p>Now you'll need to add the gpg key you made above to paella, so that paella can install
the packages from the new mirror.  Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-import --aptkey /freespace/debian/paella.gpg
</pre>
<p>Now check that the key has been imported.  There is a small apt key manager in the gui
for this.  This is a rather new part of the gui, so the interface is far from complete.  At
the moment you can only add keys, not remove them.  The apt key manager can be reached
from the &quot;main paella window&quot; Main menu on the menu bar.  You should see the name
and key id of the paella key on the list.  The name is taken from the filename when you
imported the key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-the-default-environment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Edit the Default Environment</a></h2>
<p>Access to the default environment is provided on the &quot;list menu&quot; in the &quot;main paella
window&quot;, under the &quot;environ&quot; item in the list.  Click on the &quot;+&quot; to the left of the &quot;environ&quot;
list item, and two list items will be displayed below the environ item, named &quot;current&quot; and
&quot;default&quot;.  You will want to click on &quot;default&quot;.  This will bring up the &quot;Default Environment&quot;
manager.  To edit the default environment, press the &quot;edit&quot; button in the toolbar.  This will
bring up a text editor (if you're using kate, you'll have to select the session first).  The file
format is the same as the paellarc config file.</p>
<p>There are only two options that you will probably want to change.  The &quot;archive_keys&quot;
option is a comma separated list of key names that will be used for the installer.  The key,
&quot;paella&quot;, should already be here.  If you named your key something else, or have other keys
that you want to use, you need to list them here.  The other option is &quot;http_mirror&quot;, and you
will want to either set this to &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://paella.lapnet/debian">http://paella.lapnet/debian</a>&quot; .  You must save the file and
exit the text editor for paella to save the information to the database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-machine-to-install">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Create A Machine to Install</a></h1>
<p>We're done with the paella VM for a little bit.  Now it's time to create a new VM which will be
used to install a system.  You don't want to poweroff or reboot the paella VM, since we'll be
using again shortly.</p>
<div class="section" id="side-salad-to-a-paella">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Side Salad to a Paella</a></h2>
<p>Creating the next machine will be almost just like creating the paella VM.  This new machine
should be named &quot;sidesalad&quot;, as that's what I'm going to be calling for the remainder of this
quickstart document.  Follow the instructions for making the paella VM, except keep the
memory at its default setting (or you can probably go down to 128M without problems if you're
starved for memory).  Make sure that you create the 8GB virtual hard drive, else we won't have
a device on which to install.</p>
<p>Now with &quot;sidesalad&quot; selected in the VirtualBox frontend, press the Settings button on the
toolbar.  On this machine, you'll need to configure the network interface to use the internal
network, just as you configured the secondary network adapter on the paella VM.  Be sure to
use the name &quot;lapnet&quot; for the network name.  Also, in the General settings, click the Advanced
tab.  You need to check the box to the left of Network in the &quot;Boot Order&quot; window, and move
Network all the way to the top.  This will let it boot from the network first.  These should be the
only configuration changes you'll need to make.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boot-the-new-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Boot the new machine</a></h2>
<p>Now we're ready to boot the machine.  The machine should boot straight from the network
without any problems.  If this doesn't happen, it's a sign that something went wrong.  If I have
time later, I might write a short troubleshooting section to help figure out what went wrong.  If
you haven't strayed from the defaults, and have been following this document closely, the
machine should boot.  I've done everything I can think of to make this process as easy as
possible, so that when you get to this step, you'll have a VM booting from the internal network,
but it's possible that I forgot something somewhere.  If you are absolutely sure that you have
followed this quickstart step by step and haven't got the new machine to boot from the network,
I'd really like to know about it, so we can figure out what went wrong, and how to adjust this
document to be prepared for that possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tell-paella-about-the-new-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id32">Tell Paella about the new machine</a></h2>
<p>If sidesalad booted from the network correctly, at the end of the boot process, there should
be a message explaining that this is an unknown machine, and to use paella-submit-machine
to tell paella about it.  This is what we're going to do now.  Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-submit-machine sidesalad
</pre>
<p>This will insert the mac addresses of all the ethernet interfaces into the database, tied to the
name &quot;sidesalad&quot;.  These addresses are inserted into the default_environment table.  The
paella database user only has INSERT and SELECT access to the default_environment table.
If there are matching addresses already present in the table, the inserts will not take place.
This could mean that the addresses have already been matched to another machine (this
shouldn't happen in this quickstart, but it's something that the admin needs to be aware of).
The only table that the paella database user has full write access to is the current_environment
table.  All other tables are read-only to the paella database user.</p>
<p>There's nothing else to be done with the sidesalad machine at this moment, so go ahead and
shut it down:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo poweroff
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manage-the-database-again">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">Manage the database again</a></h2>
<p>Now we need to go back to the paella VM.  Edit the default environment, and set the
sidesalad option to 'True' in the autoinstall section.  This will tell the paella-init-nfsinstaller
script to install the machine, once it boots.  The admin should be aware about this part of
the default environment, since when the autoinstall value is set to 'True', the machine will
install each time it's booted from the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-the-sidesalad-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">Create the Sidesalad Machine</a></h2>
<p>Now we are ready to create the sidesalad machine in the database.</p>
<p><strong>If you've made it this far, and the &quot;unfinished&quot; disclaimer is still at the top of this document, feel free to play around with paella anyway, and see if you can figure out how to use it.</strong></p>
