<!-- introductory comment -->
<p>Paella depends on a particular type of setup to operate.  This document details how to
bootstrap that setup, starting from the bare minimum requirements.  This guide is written
with the goal of minimizing the requirement for the root account to setup the system.  The
former method of working with paella, required (possibly) extensive configuring of a local
network.  In order to effectively use paella in a &quot;production&quot; environment, where you are
actually installing machines, still requires the same type of network configuration.  It is hoped
that the method outlined here can help prepare this by using paella to generate the
configuration that paella requires.</p>
<p>When I began writing this quickstart, I tried to give detailed instructions on how to perform
each step in this guide.  During the process of getting this quickstart guide prepared for
people to start using it, I wrote some scripts, and expanded some scripts, so that the
amount of work needed to complete the quickstart has been minimized.  While I hope
writing the scripts to do more of the work will help readers move through the guide more
easily, those scripts also impede the reader from learning about how things are done.  As
a compromise, I've left many of the more important steps included in this guide, even though
the actions are now being done by the scripts.  Doing this may have made this guide a bit
more difficult to read, although I have tried to explain the sections that are optional.</p>
<p>While I have tried to make use of an optional local debian mirror, and optional installation
of virtualbox guest additions, these are mainly to help me test this procedure.  I strongly
recommend to use an official debian mirror, and to not worry about installing the guest
additions, as you may experience problems with this quickstart.  I am convinced that you
will have an easier time going through this quickstart if you try your best to follow it step
by step, and ignore the parts where you are being told that you can edit a script before
running it.  After you go through the quickstart once, you can then look back and determine
how to configure a local mirror, or other options and shape them closer to your desire.  This
guide is meant to provide a way to see what paella is, and how it works, without you having
to worry about extensive changes to your host system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Requirements</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="time">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Time</a></h2>
<p>Stepping through this quickstart guide will take some time.  Most of the time will be spent
in waiting for the system to be installed, and for packages to be downloaded from the
internet.  The effort required to type the commands necessary to complete this guide has
been minimized, and should only require a simple cut and paste in most circumstances.  The
time required to complete this guide will still take a few hours.  I will try to give time estimates
for the longest tasks in this guide.  These estimates will be taken from a test run, using a
local debian mirror.  I am going to approximate the size of the downloads at these steps, so you
will be better able to calculate the time required with your internet connection.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this guide can be completed in about 3 to 4 hours, although it may take a lot
less, depending on your machines, network connection, and your knowledge of debian.  Much
of this time should come from reading this document.  If you already know the guide step by
step, then the time required should be less than 2 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Debian</a></h2>
<p>You should be running debian to follow this quickstart procedure.  It's technically not
required, but this document will assume that your running either lenny, sid, or etch
with VirtualBox running (from backports.org or similar).  This procedure has been tested
while running sid, although lenny should work just fine.  There also shouldn't really be
any problem with using etch, save for having to have VirtualBox installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Hardware</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart routine was developed and tested using a laptop with 3GB of memory.
You could probably get by with less which I will try to estimate later.  Most of the memory
is required to run the virtual machines.  I estimate that only 2GB of ram will be required.
Please note that this is only the hardware requirements for following this quickstart
procedure, and doesn't reflect the actual requirements to run paella in a regular
environment with a network of machines.</p>
<p>You will need to run an operating system that can host VirtualBox OSE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualbox-ose">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">VirtualBox OSE</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart will use VirtualBox OSE to setup the machine that will act as the main
paella server, and also to make machines to test those installs.  The procedure outlined
below is assuming that you are using a GNU/Linux system as a host for VirtualBox OSE, but
there shouldn't be anything stopping somebody from using VirtualBox  on another host OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="networking">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Networking</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart has been written to use 10.0.1.0 for the internal network that the virtual
machines will be using.  The main virtual machine (paella.lapnet) will be using the 10.0.1.1
ip, while the other virtual machines will be obtaining their ip's from the dhcp server running
on paella.lapnet.  It is desirable to keep these defaults if at all possible.  If these ip numbers
conflict with your setup, I have tried to make it as easy as possible to use another block of
ip's.  If you can't use the 10.0.1.0 network, I recommend that you still use some block inside
the 10.0.x.0 network.  I have tested the quickstart while changing the network to 10.0.x.0, and
it appears to work without problems (when x is either 1, 2, or 3).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-netinst-cd-image-lenny">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Debian Netinst CD Image (Lenny)</a></h2>
<p>The stable (lenny) release is what is currently supported.  You should get the netinst iso,
which available on this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">page</a>.  I used the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-500-i386-netinst.iso">i386</a> image.  Hopefully any architecture should work,
but at the moment, only i386 is tested.  When I'm satisfied that the i386 is working properly, I'll
be testing the amd64 architecture.  Feedback on any other architectures would be appreciated.
If you are using a virtualbox version less than 2, you will have to use the i386 image, as the guest
machines will only run i386 code.  The virtualbox-ose package that ships with debian lenny is
version 1.6.6, which will require using i386 guests.  There are newer virtualbox-ose packages
available at <a class="reference external" href="http://backports.org">http://backports.org</a> that will run amd64 code on the guests, if you wish to use
those.  This quickstart should work with any version from 1.6.6 and above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Setup the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="remaster-the-netinst-iso">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Remaster the netinst iso</a></h2>
<p>This step is highly recommended.  This step is technically optional, but it may be handy,
especially if you have an application that can remaster an iso image.  This allows you to
preseed the debian installer and make an automated install.  Even though this step is
technically optional, it would be a very good idea to get the script below, and the files that
are obtained through subversion in the script to get an idea of how to proceed manually
without performing this step.</p>
<p>If you are running debian, remastering the iso is easy:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir remaster-netinst
cd remaster-netinst
svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p>if you already grabbed the netinst iso image, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso /path/to/debian-501-i386-netinst.iso
</pre>
<p>if you haven't gotten the netinst iso image yet, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p>The script will attempt to download the netinst iso for lenny, but it may be out of date
when by the time you read this, so you are recommended to download the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd">iso</a> manually.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!!!</strong>  This script uses sudo to perform the loopback mounting of the iso
image.  Be sure to look over the script really good before you execute it.  You may want to
change the ARCH variable near the top of the file (note: only i386 is tested at the moment).
Be sure that you have rsync, sudo, genisoimage, and subversion installed.</p>
<p>This script is the only place where you will need to have root access on the host
system.  Every other script that requires root permissions, will be run on a virtual machine.</p>
<p>The script will give you a chance to review and edit the preseed files before you create the
remastered iso image.  All the files that will be used in the remastered iso image will be
located in the cd/ directory. If you have a local mirror that you want to install from, you should
edit the localmirror.cfg file in the cd/ directory.  When the script is finished, the iso image will be
./paella-netinst.iso .</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  The preseed configuration files, and the setup scripts assume that the locale
is set to en_US.UTF-8 .  If you are using another locale, you really need to modify both the
preseed.cfg file, and the setup-paella-server script.  The postgresql database server will not
run unless your locale is generated, and referenced in the postgresql.conf file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-virtualbox">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Start VirtualBox</a></h2>
<p>You need to get the virtualbox frontend up and running.  The user interface varies between
different versions of virtualbox.  These instructions were written using version 1.6.6, which
is the default version in debian lenny.  To start the virtualbox gui type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
virtualbox
</pre>
<p>Make a new machine using the wizard provided by the virtualbox frontend.  Press next
and name the machine &quot;paella&quot;.  Select &quot;Debian&quot; for the OS type.  Press next.  Set the base
memory size to 256MB.  Press next.  Make a new disk image at the default 8GB size (I chose
dynamically expanding size).  Press finish.</p>
<p>Select paella from the list of machines on the frontend, and click the settings button.  In the
configuration dialog, select CD/DVD-ROM on the left hand side.  Click on the Mount CD/DVD
Drive button at the top.  Select the ISO Image File.  Press the folder on the right to bring up
the Virtual Disk Manager.  Here you want to add the netinst iso that you remastered.  It should
be called paella-netinst-$arch.iso, where $arch is the architecture that either you are running,
or that you selected.  Close the Virtual Disk Manager, and make sure that the iso is selected as
the image file that will be mounted.</p>
<p>Now, select the Network part of the list of the left hand side of the settings dialog.  By default,
the network adapter should be enabled, and set to NAT.  This is what we want.  We also want
to add another network interface to this machine, so select the Adapter 2 tab.  Click the
&quot;Enable Network Adapter&quot; button.  Make sure the &quot;Attached to&quot; selection is set to &quot;Internal
Network&quot;.  You will need to name the network in the field that says &quot;Network Name&quot;.  Any name
should do just fine.  I used &quot;lapnet&quot; (no quotes), since I'm on a laptop.  Remember this name,
since you'll need this for the other machine(s) that you will use paella to install to.</p>
<p>If you are using an newer 64 bit processor that has hardware virtualization support, you may want
to enable this in the general preferences, as the virtual machine will run much faster.</p>
<!-- Boot the paella virtual machine -->
<!-- ================================ -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="install-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Install the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>Now you should be ready to boot the virtual machine, and install debian lenny.</p>
<p>Boot the machine by pressing Start (the green arrow) on the virtualbox frontend (make sure
the paella virtual machine is the one that's selected).  When the boot screen appears, select
one of the first two menu options.  Don't bother selecting the second option unless you have
a local debian mirror, and you have modified the preseed files.</p>
<p>If you remastered the netinst iso, the install will proceed automatically.  The setup scripts
will be copied to /usr/local/bin by the debian installer.</p>
<p>If you didn't remaster the netinst file, you can find the preseed files, and the setup scripts
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de/netinst/">netinst</a> directory on the paella website.  You can just install debian in the normal
manner.  You'll need to select the standard, desktop, and database-server tasks.  Look at
the preseed file to see how the default setup is configured.  The hostname, main user, and
the main user's password are all set to &quot;paella&quot; to make it easy to remember.  The paella
user should be added to the src, staff, adm, and sudo groups, but this probably isn't
an absolute necessity.  Set the dhcp3-server to listen to eth1 on the debconf question.</p>
<p>The rest of the instructions will assume that you installed from a remastered iso.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step took me around 20 minutes to complete, and required ~280 megabytes of
packages to installed (~80 megabytes were already present on the netinst iso).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-boot-on-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">First boot on the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>After the debian installer is finished, the virtual machine should reboot .  You should take
this time to disassociate the iso image from the machine in the VirtualBox frontend, else
the iso will boot everytime you boot the virtual machine.  You may also want to save a
snapshot of the virtual machine, in case you have problems with the initial setup script.</p>
<p>When the system boots up for the first time, you will want to want to login to the console.
You can reach the console by pressing the &quot;Host&quot; key and F1 (By default, the &quot;Host&quot; key
is the right &lt;ctrl&gt; key).  You will want to login here, instead of to the X session, because
the script will reconfigure X and restart the display manager.</p>
<p>Once you switch to the local console, you will need to login as paella (password paella).
Here you will run a script that will help configure the server and get it ready for the rest
of this procedure.  The script is located at /usr/local/bin/setup-paella-server .  You may
need to edit the script and set the ip addresses that are set near the top.  The default
internal network that is used is 10.0.1.0/24.  You may need to change this if the ip
values conflict with your local network setup.  I suggest you try to stick to these values
if it's possible, and if it's not possible, to use 10.0.2.0/24, or something similar.</p>
<p>Please note that the script will try to install the guest utils and build the guest modules.
If you are not running virtualbox-ose version 1.6.6, you may need to may want to set
&quot;do_backports&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; in the script.  If the version of virtualbox-ose that you are using
doesn't match the version that's available at backports.org, the guest additions are
unlikely to work.  The guest additions are not absolutely necessary.  They just help
keep the mouse from feeling jerky, and also help configure the size of the screen to
more comfortable resolutions.  The attempt to build and install the guest additions
happens at the very end of the script, so if you have problems with this and using the
backports repository doesn't help, you will have to do without the guest modules.  If
you can't use the guest modules, you may need to use a modified xorg.conf to adjust
the resolution of the screen on the guest machine.  Regardless of whether the guest
additions are installed or not, the script will create an example xorg.conf located at
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.unused .  You may copy this to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and modify it
as you need.  If you do this, you must use a resolution that the vesa driver supports.</p>
<p>When  you are ready you should type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo setup-paella-server
</pre>
<p>This should set up everything that couldn't be done on the debian installer.  This script
will setup the cofiguration of the database, firewall, dhcp server, and the network interface
for the internal network.  Also, the virtualbox guest modules will be installed, and the
xorg.conf configuration will be modified to make use of them.  The script will need to
download about 11 megabytes worth of packages to build the guest modules with
module-assistant.  When the script is finished, you should see a graphical login screen.
You may want to return to the console that you are logged into to logout before logging
into the X session.</p>
<p>Once you have logged into the X session, you may want to load this page on a web
browser in the virtual machine and continue this guide.  This will make it easier to
cut and paste the commands that are given here.  The rest of the guide will assume that
you have done this.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step took me around 5 minutes to complete.  I chose to build guest
additions from backports.org, which required about ~15 megabytes of extra packages
to be installed.</p>

<div class="section" id="create-a-partial-debian-archive">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Create a Partial Debian Archive</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="make-a-gpg-key">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Make a gpg key</a></h2>
<p>You'll need a gpg key to sign the Release files of the local debian repository.  This is important,
since debian has spent a great deal of time making it possible to verify the authenticity of the
packages being installed on your system.  Full instructions on how to generate a key and use it
properly are beyond the scope of this docuement.  You can find more detailed
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a> .</p>
<p>I have written a script that will help create a key to sign the archives with.  This key will be
created without a passphrase and should only be used with this quickstart guide.</p>
<p>To run the script, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generate-gpg-key
</pre>
<p>If you need more random bytes, try moving the mouse around a lot, and pecking the keyboard
randomly in a text editor.  To get the disk moving, type this in another terminal window:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
find /usr/share | xargs sha1sum
</pre>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step took me around 2 minutes to complete.  Time here will vary randomly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-initial-debian-mirror">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Setup initial debian mirror</a></h2>
<p>I have written a script to help setup the partial debian repository that will be used in this
guide.  <strong>Note:</strong>  If you used a local mirror with the netinst iso, the script may fail during
the final part.</p>
<p>To run the script, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
initialize-local-debian-repository
</pre>
<p>The script will call apt-move to install the packages located in /var/cache/apt/archives
into the local repository.  It will then setup reprepro and fill the repository with the rest
of the packages that will be needed to finish this guide.  It will use the gpg key that you
created above to sign the repository, add that key to apt, add the local repository to
/etc/apt/sources.list, and run apt-get update.</p>
<p>Take a break.  Grab some coffee.  This will take a bit, depending on your internet
connection.  I've taken care to only include the packages that needed, plus a few
extra packages that I use as tools to help me test this quickstart routine.  I estimate
about 180 megabytes of packages will need to be downloaded during this step.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If the script failed, and you installed from a local mirror, you will need to
edit the /freespace/debian/conf/updates file and adjust the VerifyRelease fields in
the update stanzas.  You may have to import a key using gpg --import, or you may
just remove the VerifyRelease fields from the stanzas.  Once you are sure the
stanzas are correct, you can type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
reprepro -b /freespace/debian -VV --noskipold update
sudo apt-get update
</pre>
<p>This will finish preparing the initial debian repository, and use that repository
in your apt sources.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  Using a local mirror, this step took about 5 minutes.  You should adjust this
time by the time it takes to download about 180M from your internet connection.  From this
point on, there should be no need to download anything more packages from a debian
mirror.  The rest of the times will depend entirely on the speed of your system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obtain-paella-from-berlios">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Obtain Paella from Berlios</a></h2>
<p>Now you're ready to get the source code from berlios.de.  To do this, type</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd
paella-user-quick-setup
</pre>
<p>This will setup the directories, and download the source code from either the berlios
subversion repository, or the berlios ftp site.  It will also install build dependencies,
plus some extra packages required to create the netboot image that will be made later
in this guide.  It will then build the packages and install them into your freshly made
debian repository.  After that, it will update apt, then install the paella-admin,
paella-installer, and paella-defaultdb packages.  Then it will import the quickstart
database from the paella-defaultdb package into the postgresql database.  It will also
import the archive key that you created earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step is a bit more involved than the other steps, so far, and it will take
some time to complete.  During the import of the database, package lists will be downloaded
from official debian mirrors, totalling just over 8 megabytes.  This step took me about
8 minutes to complete.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Why Debian Live?</a></h2>
<p>Now you're ready to make the live nfsroot installer.  In the past, I had done this with paella,
and I had a flaky configuration that worked, albeit just barely.  In the beginning, I had to
compile a special kernel to allow me to mount an nfsroot, and have the network drivers
compiled right into the kernel image.  Later, the work on the initrd filesystem allowed me to
use stock kernels to boot from an nfsroot, but the readonly live nfsroot was flaky and limited
at best.  These days, there's <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive">DebianLive</a> to help do much of the dirty work here.  It's even
possible to use DebianLive to make a live iso with the paella installer on it, for machines
that won't boot off of the network.  I actually had to do this with the older livecd package in
the past, but DebianLive is much better.  Now I can leave the management of a good live
system in somebody else's hands, and just concentrate on using that live system as an
installer for paella.</p>
<p>I have written a script that will help build the live netboot image for the installer.  To run
the script , type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
create-debian-live-image
</pre>
<p>This script will copy the live-helper config files to /freespace/live/config and build the
image, then install the image and the tftpboot files to the appropriate locations.  This
step will take quite a while, so this is a good place to take a break and let the machine
do its work.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>  If you aren't able to use 10.0.1.1 as the ip address of your eth1 interface
on the virtual machine, you will have to edit /freespace/live/config/binary and set
LH_NET_ROOT_SERVER to the value of the ip that you will be using and then build the image
again.</p>
<p>Here are some quick instructions on how to do that:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd /freespace/live
sudo lh_clean --purge
rm -fr .stage
mkdir .stage
touch .stage/bootstrap
sudo paella-machine-installer install live_chroot chroot
sudo lh_build
sudo ./config/prepare-netboot
</pre>
<p>While the paella installer is installing the chroot machine, you can watch the progress in
the logfile, /freespace/paellalog/paella-install-live_chroot.log .  You can do this with the
most program.  Bring up another terminal, and make it bigger, if you want to.  In the
terminal, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
most /freespace/paellalog/paella-install-live_chroot.log
</pre>
<p>Then press 'b', followed by &lt;Shift&gt;-F.  Now you'll be able to watch the progress of the
live_chroot machine as it's being installed.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step, takes a long time to complete, and it's probably the longest step
in this guide.  The installation of the chroot will take about 10 minutes.  After that the
live-helper scripts will take the chroot and make a squashfs image from it.  All in all, it
seems to take about 20 minutes to fully complete this step.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Using Paella Management Interface</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="install-the-admin-package">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Install the Admin Package</a></h2>
<p>Now we're almost ready to use the management interface.  The package containing
this application should've been installed earlier when you ran the &quot;paella-user-quick-setup&quot;
script earlier.  In case you still need to install it, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install paella-admin
</pre>
<p>The executable is called <strong>paella-management</strong>.  You can either type it into a
terminal, or find it in the debian menu (but not in the kde menu, yet).  Don't run it yet, you
should set up the configuration file first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-paellarc">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">Setup ~/.paellarc</a></h2>
<p>The master config file will be found at /etc/paellarc .  The master config file is the one that
the installer will use.  You can copy this file to ~/.paellarc and edit it.  The paella-management
program will read the master config file, then the local one at ~/.paellarc .  The local file will
override options in the master file.  If you are not familiar with the file format, you can read
about it <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html">here</a> .  Options that are prefixed by an underscore are not referenced in the code.
You can make your own underscored options, if you wish, to make it easier to edit.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd
cp /etc/paellarc .paellarc
</pre>
<p>In the database section, the dbhost option should be the ip address of the eth1 interface,
which should be 10.0.1.1 .  You will also need to change the dbusername option to the database
admin user (dbadmin).  The dbusername in the master config file should  always be &quot;paella&quot;.</p>
<p>The management_gui section has options for the paella-management application.  The options
that you may want to change here are &quot;text_editor&quot;, and &quot;x_differ&quot;.  Both of these commands
should display an X window.  For the x_differ, I highly recommend xxdiff.  I have a config file that
makes it easier to use xxdiff, located at /usr/share/doc/paella-admin/xxdiffrc .  You'll want to
copy this file to ~/.xxdiffrc .  The x_differ command line in the paellarc file conforms
to this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x_differ LeftFile RightFile
</pre>
<p>If your differ needs options on the command line, please write a wrapper for it, and use that.</p>
<p>There are only two text editors that I included with this quickstart routine.  They are
kate (the default) and xemacs.  If you wish to use another one, go ahead and install it and
put the command in the ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p>You should not need to change any other options.</p>
<p>The paellarc configuration file is used by two distinct users, the database admin, and the
paella installer.  Much of the configuration in the paellarc file is used for the database admin.
The paella installer user only needs the database section of the paellarc file, as this user
uses the paella database for the rest of his configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-paella-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">Start paella-management</a></h2>
<p>Run the paella-management script to start the management interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-management
</pre>
<p>The little window that pops up is the main menu for paella.  From here on, I'll refer it as
the &quot;main paella window&quot;.  There are two menu systems on the &quot;main paella window&quot;.  One
of them is the standard menu bar at the top.  The other one is the list right below the menu
bar.  This is the list that contains &quot;differs, environ, familes, ...&quot;.  This is the part of the
interface that has so far defied any conformance to standards that you might be used to.
I'm going to be calling this part of the interface the &quot;list menu&quot;.</p>
<p>The first thing that you will want to do is to connect to the database.  There is a connect button
on the toolbar for you to press.  The connection dialog entries are taken from your ~/.paellarc
file.  The settings for postgresql in this quickstart don't require a password for dbadmin, but
you'll want to use one if you use paella in a production environment.</p>
<p>If you didn't run the &quot;paella-user-quick-setup&quot; script above, or if there were problems
encountered when running the script , then once you connect to the database, you
should get a dialog asking to create the primary tables.  You should click yes here
to setup an empty database structure.  If you don't do this, the database import procedure
will create these tables for you, but you won't be able to use the paella-management interface
until you do this.</p>
<p>If the &quot;paella-user-quick-setup&quot; script ran without problems, the quickstart database
should already imported, and you can skip the next section that describes how to import
the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-the-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">Import the database</a></h2>
<p>If the &quot;paella-user-quick-setup&quot; script ran without problems, you should already have the
quickstart database imported.  If there were problems running the script, you'll have to
follow the instructions in this section to import the quickstart database.  Otherwise, you
can skip this section.</p>
<p>You may need to install the paella-defaultdb package:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo apt-get install paella-defaultdb
</pre>
<p>Now we are going to import the startup database.  You may need an internet connection to
import the database.  The importer downloads the Packages files from the debian mirror in
the database.xml file, and inserts them into the database.  Go to the menubar, and in the
database menu, select &quot;import database&quot;.  A directory selection dialog will appear.  On the
VM I tested, this window was a little bit too skinny, so you'll probably need to make it wider
with your mouse.  The database directory will be at:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/usr/share/paella/databases/quickstart-vbox/
</pre>
<p>Note that the default debian mirror is  <a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian</a> .  If you need to
change this, copy the quickstart-vbox directory, then edit the database.xml file
in the new quickstart-vbox  directory, and alter the uri attribute to the aptsource xml
element at the top of the file.  You can change this to a local mirror if you already have
one.  I recommend against using the local mirror that you just created in this quickstart
routine, as you would likely want to make new traits with packages that aren't available
in that mirror.  Paella has only been tested with http apt sources, it's behaviour on other
methods is unknown.</p>
<p>If everything is working, you should be seeing an ugly little progress dialog displaying
something resembling what it should be doing.  I need to fix this dialog to make it more
accurate, but at least you'll see it working while it inserts the information into the
database.  The packages will probably take a little while to insert.  The apt_source_packages
table can take a lot of space that could be better saved.  In the future, it will probably default
to only holding package names rather than the other attributes in the Packages file.  The
reason they are there is to help keep the automated installations from bombing due to
unavailable or misspelled packages.  It would also be nice to have a little package browser
to help when creating traits, but that's in the future, and it would need the full record of each
package to be stored in the database.</p>

<div class="section" id="add-the-archive-key">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Add the archive key</a></h2>
<p>If you ran the &quot;paella-user-quick-setup&quot; script above, the archive key that you made
earlier should already be imported into the paella database.  If this didn't occur, or
you need to import another key, the instructions to do this lie below.  If you do import
more archive keys, see the section below on editing the default environment so you
can learn how to get paella to use those keys in an install.</p>
<p>Now you'll need to add the gpg key you made above to paella, so that paella can install
the packages from the new mirror.  Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-import --aptkey /freespace/debian/paella.gpg
</pre>
<p>Now check that the key has been imported.  There is a small apt key manager in the gui
for this.  This is a rather new part of the gui, so the interface is far from complete.  At
the moment you can only add keys, not remove them.  The apt key manager can be reached
from the &quot;main paella window&quot; Main menu on the menu bar.  You should see the name
and key id of the paella key on the list.  The name is taken from the filename when you
imported the key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-the-default-environment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Edit the Default Environment</a></h2>
<p>Access to the default environment is provided on the &quot;list menu&quot; in the &quot;main paella
window&quot;, under the &quot;environ&quot; item in the list.  Click on the &quot;+&quot; to the left of the &quot;environ&quot;
list item, and two list items will be displayed below the environ item, named &quot;current&quot; and
&quot;default&quot;.  You will want to click on &quot;default&quot;.  This will bring up the &quot;Default Environment&quot;
manager.  To edit the default environment, press the &quot;edit&quot; button in the toolbar.  This will
bring up a text editor (if you're using kate, you'll have to select the session first).  The file
format is the same as the paellarc config file.</p>
<p>There are only two options that you will probably want to change.  The &quot;archive_keys&quot;
option is a comma separated list of key names that will be used for the installer.  The key,
&quot;paella&quot;, should already be here.  If you named your key something else, or have other keys
that you want to use, you need to list them here.  The other option is &quot;http_mirror&quot;, and you
will want make sure this is set to &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://paella.lapnet/debian">http://paella.lapnet/debian</a>&quot; .  You must save the file and
exit the text editor for paella to save the information to the database.</p>

<div class="section" id="create-a-machine-to-install">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Create A Machine to Install</a></h1>
<p>We're done with the paella VM for a little bit.  Now it's time to create a new VM which will be
used to install a system.  You don't want to poweroff or reboot the paella VM, since we'll be
using again shortly.</p>
<div class="section" id="side-salad-to-a-paella">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id32">Side Salad to a Paella</a></h2>
<p>Creating the next machine will be almost just like creating the paella VM.  This new machine
should be named &quot;sidesalad&quot;, as that's what I'm going to be calling for the remainder of this
quickstart document.  Follow the instructions for making the paella VM, except keep the
memory at its default setting (or you can probably go down to 128M without problems if you're
starved for memory).  Make sure that you create the 8GB virtual hard drive, else we won't have
a device on which to install.</p>
<p>Now with &quot;sidesalad&quot; selected in the VirtualBox frontend, press the Settings button on the
toolbar.  On this machine, you'll need to configure the first network interface to use the
internal network, just as you configured the secondary network adapter on the paella VM.
Be sure to use the name &quot;lapnet&quot; for the network name.  The secondary network adapter
will also need to be set to use an internal network, and the network name should be
&quot;lapnet2&quot;</p>
<p>These should be the only configuration changes you'll need to make for the sidesalad
machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boot-the-new-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">Boot the new machine</a></h2>
<p>Now we're ready to boot the machine.  In order to boot from the network, press &quot;F12&quot;
when the boot screen appears, then select &quot;l&quot;.</p>
<p>The machine should boot straight from the network without any problems.  If this doesn't
happen, it's a sign that something went wrong.  If I have time later, I might write a short
troubleshooting section to help figure out what went wrong.  If you haven't strayed from
the defaults, and have been following this document closely, the machine should boot.
I've done everything I can think of to make this process as easy as possible, so that when
you get to this step, you'll have a VM booting from the internal network, but it's possible
that I forgot something somewhere.  If you are absolutely sure that you have followed
this quickstart step by step and haven't got the new machine to boot from the network,
I'd really like to know about it, so we can figure out what went wrong, and how to adjust this
document to be prepared for that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>  From time to time, the network boot seems to stall when the live-initramfs
scripts try to configure the ip of the machine.  You will see a message like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
IP-Config: eth0 hardware address xx:xx:xx... mtu 1500 DHCP RARP
</pre>
<p>If the machine stalls at this point for more than a minute, then it will stay there forever, and
you will need to reboot the sidesalad machine and try again.  There seems to be a problem
with the manner that the dhcp client for busybox is used, and I'm not  sure whether the
problem lies in the busybox dhcp client, the live-initramfs script that uses it, or the
virtualbox internal networking.  Other dhcp methods seem to work fine, and I think that the
debian installer also uses the busybox dhcp client, so I think that the problem is in the
live-initramfs script.  Hopefully, you won't encounter this bug, as it doesn't occur often, but
it does seem to occur about 5-10% of the time.  If this happens to you, just press the &quot;Host&quot;
key (right &lt;ctrl&gt;) and &quot;r&quot; to reset the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tell-paella-about-the-new-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">Tell Paella about the new machine</a></h2>
<p>If sidesalad booted from the network correctly, at the end of the boot process, there should
be a message explaining that this is an unknown machine, and to use paella-submit-machine
to tell paella about it.  This is what we're going to do now.  Type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-submit-machine sidesalad
</pre>
<p>This will insert the mac addresses of all the ethernet interfaces into the database, tied to the
name &quot;sidesalad&quot;.  These addresses are inserted into the default_environment table.  The
paella database user only has INSERT and SELECT access to the default_environment table.
If there are matching addresses already present in the table, the inserts will not take place.
This could mean that the addresses have already been matched to another machine (this
shouldn't happen in this quickstart, but it's something that the admin needs to be aware of).
The only table that the paella database user has full write access to is the current_environment
table.  All other tables are read-only to the paella database user.</p>
<p>There's nothing else to be done with the sidesalad machine at this moment, so go ahead and
shut it down:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo poweroff
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manage-the-database-again">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id35">Manage the database again</a></h2>
<p>Now we need to go back to the paella VM.  Edit the default environment, and set the
sidesalad option to 'True' in the autoinstall section.  This will tell the paella-init-nfsinstaller
script to install the machine, once it boots.  The admin should be aware about this part of
the default environment, since when the autoinstall value is set to 'True', the machine will
install each time it's booted from the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-the-sidesalad-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">Create the Sidesalad Machine</a></h2>
<p>Now we are ready to create the sidesalad machine in the database.  You will need to
start an instance of the machine manager, which you can do by selecting &quot;machines&quot; from
the list in main paella window.  When the machine manager shows up on the desktop, you
will then select &quot;manage machines&quot; from the Main menu.  This will set the machine manager
to manage machines.  The machine manager is built to manage machines, diskconfigs, and
kernels.</p>
<p>When the machine manager is set to manage machines, you should see a short list of machines
on the left hand side of the manager.  Selecting a machine from the list will display the machine
on the right hand side of the manager.  Now you will want to create a new machine.  You can
select &quot;New&quot; from the main menu, or press the &quot;New&quot; icon on the toolbar.  Doing this will
cause a dialog box to be displayed asking for the name of the new machine.  You will want to
enter &quot;sidesalad&quot; into the text entry in the dialog.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-the-sidesalad-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id37">Configure the Sidesalad Machine</a></h2>
<p>Now it's time to configure the sidesalad machine.  You will want to select &quot;sidesalad&quot; from the
list of machines on the left hand side of the manager.  The first thing that you will wan to do is
select a parent for the machine.  In the quickstart database, all of the machines are set to be
children of the &quot;default&quot; machine.  Since, sidesalad is going to be another paella server,
similar to the paella machine, we want its parent to be &quot;paellabase&quot;.</p>
<p>Next, we want to select the profile that will be installed on the sidesalad machine.  The profile
should already be set by the &quot;paellabase&quot; machine to &quot;paella_vbox&quot;.  Make sure that the
profile is set to this.</p>
<p>Next we want to add a family.  Click on the &quot;new&quot; link next to the &quot;Families&quot; section title.  This
will bring up a dialog box.  We want to type &quot;lapnet2&quot; into the box and press &quot;Ok&quot;.  The lapnet2
family will override the lapnet family in the &quot;paella_vbox&quot; profile (more accurately, the variables
in the lapnet2 family will override the variables in the lapnet family).  The lapnet2 family is used
to distinguish sidesalad from paella.  It uses the 10.0.2.0/24 network, with the domain named
&quot;lapnet2&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we want to set the hostname for sidesalad.  Click on the &quot;new&quot; link next to the &quot;Variables&quot;
section title.  This will bring up a dialog box, requesting you to fill out the trait, name and value
of the new variable.  You'll need to enter &quot;global&quot; for the trait, &quot;hostname&quot; for the name, and
&quot;sidesalad&quot; for the value.</p>
<p>Now we need to set the installer machine that sidesalad will host.  Click on the &quot;new&quot; link next
to the &quot;Variables&quot; section title, as in the paragraph above.  In this dialog box, you will need to
set the entry for trait to &quot;paella_server&quot;, the entry for name to &quot;installer_machine&quot;, and the
value to &quot;live_chroot2&quot;.  The live_chroot2 machine should already be present in the database,
and it's configured to talk to sidesalad to get the install information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boot-sidesalad-again">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id38">Boot Sidesalad Again</a></h2>
<p>Boot the sidesalad machine from the network again.  This time the sidesalad machine
should start installing automatically.</p>
<p>While the paella installer is installing the sidesalad machine, you can watch the progress in
the logfile, /freespace/paellalog/paella-install-sidesalad.log on the paella machine.  You can
do this with the most program.  Bring up another terminal, and make it bigger, if you want
to.  In the terminal, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
most /freespace/paellalog/paella-install-sidesalad.log
</pre>
<p>Then press 'b', followed by &lt;Shift&gt;-F.  Now you'll be able to watch the progress of the
sidesalad machine as it's being installed.</p>
<p>While the live installer that sidesalad will host is being installed, you can follow the progress
by looking at /freespace/paellalog/paella-install-live_chroot2.log .</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step can take a while.  In many ways, this step is a composition of the steps
that have already been performed.  The sidesalad machine should be extremely similar to the
paella machine.  The main difference is that you don't need to download packages from the
internet, but from the paella machine, which should be faster.  In total, this step should take
about 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reboot-sidesalad-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id39">Reboot Sidesalad Machine</a></h2>
<p>Once the installer finishes, we can reboot into the new system.  On the sidesalad machine,
type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo reboot
</pre>
<p>(load this page on sidesalad, so you can cut and paste the commands below)</p>
<p>Now the machine should boot from the hard drive.  When the machine finishes booting, there
are only a few commands left to make sidesalad a paella server.  The login should be the
same as the paella machine (user: paella, password: paella).</p>
<p>First, we need to copy the debian repository over to sidesalad:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rsync -av paella.lapnet:/freespace/debian/ /freespace/debian
</pre>
<p>You will probably get an error about setting time on /freespace/debian, but otherwise this
command should work.</p>
<p>Next, we need to copy the archive key (the private one):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rsync -av paella.lapnet:~/.gnupg ~/
</pre>
<p>After that we will import the database that was exported from paella.lapnet while sidesalad
was being installed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PAELLA_DBUSER=dbadmin PAELLA_DBHOST=127.0.1.1 paella-import /var/cache/paella/export/database.xml
</pre>
<p>Finally, we need to create the debian live image (The chroot installer was installed by the paella
installer).  A simple script was created by the installer to help with this.  You can type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo /freespace/live/make-installer-image
</pre>
<p>This step will take quite a while, so it may be a good time to pull up another terminal.  In the new
terminal, we need to copy /etc/paellarc and edit it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cp /etc/paellarc ~/.paellarc
kwrite ~/.paellarc
</pre>
<p>Set dbhost to &quot;sidesalad&quot; and dbusername to &quot;dbadmin&quot;.  Save the file and exit the editor,
then run the paella-management application:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-management
</pre>
<p>Edit the default environment and set &quot;http_mirror&quot; to &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://sidesalad.lapnet2/debian">http://sidesalad.lapnet2/debian</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, the sidesalad machine should work as a paella server.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>  This step can also take a while.  I have tried to make the live-helper step a bit
shorter by not compressing the squashfs image.  Still, this step should take about 30
minutes.</p>

<p>If you made it this far, then this quickstart guide is complete!
Congratulations on installing your first test machine with paella!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-do-i-do-now">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">What do I do now?</a></h2>
<p>If you wish, you could reinstall the paella machine, using sidesalad as the server.  The
steps to do this would be very similar to how you made the sidesalad machine, so I'm
not going to bother with the details.  This guide is long enough as it is (and it's called
a &quot;quickstart&quot; guide).  Even so, it shouldn't be difficult to figure out how to install the
paella machine  from sidesalad.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">Browse the Quickstart Database</a></h2>
<p>You could spend some time browsing the quickstart database with the paella-management
application.  This would help to see how paella is structured, and may give you some ideas
of how to use it for your machines and network(s).  Take note, the quickstart database was
forked from the default database that ships with paella in order to make it easier to
bootstrap paella, and make it through this guide.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43">Start Using the Default Database</a></h2>
<p>The default <a class="reference external" href="defaultdb.html">database</a> is probably a better database to work with, although it has some
parts that are still incomplete.  Using it will require a more complete debian mirror, plus
a local mirror of the debian repository at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/">http://www.debian-multimedia.org/</a> .  You
may also want to build a few extra packages to use with it.  The default database makes
a better use of the framework that paella provides which can help teach you how to use
paella in creating your own database.</p>
