<p>Paella is still not complete, and there is a lot of work that is intended before a
1.0 version is ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paella-management">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Paella Management</a></h1>
<p>Creating a good gui is time consuming work.  At the moment, the gui is just
barely functional in most cases, and there are still some requirements that
aren't yet implemented.</p>
<div class="section" id="large-databases">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Large Databases</a></h2>
<p>The gui and database schema are not really useful when the number of
traits, families, profiles, and machines grow very large.  I would like to be
able to create tags for families and machines (and maybe traits and profiles),
and code the management application to be able to filter the view based on the
tags.</p>
<p>I would also like to create an optional hierarchal view for traits, families, and
machines that uses a &quot;tree&quot; type of list view in the gui.  For example, if a trait/family
has a child, then the child won't be displayed on the list until the parent is &quot;expanded&quot;.
This view would look similar to a directory/subdirectory list view present in many common
file manager applications, though there will likely be repetition, as a child could have
multiple parents (excepting machines), so expanding each parent would cause the same
child to appear under each parent.  While this may look confusing, it's still only optional.  The
longer flat listing views should always be supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visual-displays-of-inheritance">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Visual Displays of Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>It would be nice to be able to see the configuration and how it's to be applied in a
more graphically oriented manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-systems">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Updating Systems</a></h1>
<p>So far, paella has only concentrated on installing a system from scratch.  It can do a
pretty good job of installing a fully preconfigured machine.  With a careful use of the
scripts, the installer can even be used to restore a machine from backups (the model
here is to install a server application, then restore the data from a previous dump).</p>
<p>Since the focus has been primarily on installing a system, and also since the machines
that I have been administring have not been adversely affected by short periods of
downtime, I have not been bothered by the details of updating and reconfiguring a live,
running system using paella.</p>
<p>I have been toying with the idea of using a separate, more widely used configuration
manager to handle this, such as cfengine or bcfg2.  I have stayed away from cfengine
as I'm a little more partial to python, than perl (which is a large reason why I first decided
to create paella on top of FAI).  Trying to get bcfg2 configured has proven to be difficult.  The
goal of being able to use another configuration  manager with paella, is to be able to export
the configuration of a machine from the paella database, and transform it to a format that
the configuration manager is able to use.  I have only recently come into contact with
<a class="reference external" href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/">puppet</a>, and I've been wondering if that's a better solution.  I'm still up in the air about using
a separate configuration manager.</p>
<p>The alternative to using a separate configuration manager is to use paella to manage the
configuration directly.  I have shyed away from this for primarily two reasons.  First, I think
that it would be better if a more widely tested and used manager was used to update the
machines, as it would probably be more secure, and there would be no need to duplicate
the functionality that is available in the configuration manager.  Second, since I have focused
paella primarily on installation, the scripts in the database presume that the machine is
in a certain state, and there aren't any checks to see what state it's in before deciding what
to do.  This method of operation works just fine in a fresh install, but could easily break a
running machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-a-paella-server">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Use a Paella Server</a></h1>
<p>I have been thinking about decoupling the database interface from the installer, and the
management application, and using an xml-rpc server as the primary interface to the
database.  This would allow paella to become more flexible in it's abilities.</p>
<p>First, it could allow for another database backend to be used.  This feature could be
important for many users, as paella would just be tied to the server interface and not
the way that the server handles the data.</p>
<p>Second, it would help to configure things on the server that currently can't be done, such
as update the dhcp server with mac addresses, and the path to the appropriate pxelinux.0
file for network booting.  This is one of the major roadblocks in getting paella to support
a network of different architectures.</p>
<p>Third, it would allow paella to be useful over the internet, or another untrusted network.  I
have always kept from exposing the sql database ports to an untrusted network, even though
there is ssl support, as I don't feel to comfortable with that idea.  Using an xml-rpc server
would allow me to run it behind apache, and add an extra security layer using a more known
and tested method.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-for-other-operating-systems">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Support for Other Operating Systems</a></h1>
<p>One of the complaints that I hear often from my friends, while I've been working on paella,
has been that it is only good for installing debian systems.  In the past, I haven't concerned
myself too much with this, primarily because there was a lot of work involved in just getting
paella to install debian systems in the manner that I desired.  A lot of time has been spent
thinking about how to divide the configuration and scripting between traits, profiles, families,
and machines.</p>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Windows</a></h2>
<p>Now that I have most of this defined and working, it's become time to more seriously consider
how to adjust paella to be a bit more OS agnostic.  In my spare time, I have been working on
integrating <a class="reference external" href="http://unattended.sourceforge.net/">unattended</a> into paella.  While is this very likely more difficult than just getting paella
to install another linux distribution, I will have a need for this in the future, and I think that
getting paella geared to install a radically different operating system, using the same (or
similar) database schema would be an accomplishment well worth the effort.</p>
<p>My progress in this has been somewhat slow, but productive.  I have already replaced the
use of the unattended linuxboot.iso with a debian-live system that does the same thing.
I have been working on creating a system to handle an &quot;apt-like&quot; repository of software,
updates, service packs, and other &quot;packages&quot; needed for a windows system.  I have used
paella to create the configuration of a server that's able to host the unattended install
server.  The latest release of unattended has postgresql support, so I can start putting
tables in the paella database that unattended can read.  On the downside, much of
unattended is written in perl, but I have configured my windows machines to install both
perl and python in the first steps, which makes it easier to use a python script to fill the
todo list that the todo.pl script uses.  So far, my success with integrating paella and
unattended has been limited, but promising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Linux</a></h2>
<p>Using paella to install a linux system is much easier than installing windows.  The flexibility
of paella allows for this to be a possibility now.  A careful use of hooking the steps of the
install process with scripts and having the necessary packages and base tarball on the
network would be all that's needed to install another linux system.  In theory, I think that
just reimplementing the bootstrap procedure, the install procedure of each trait, and the
steps that install the kernel and bootloader, and skip the steps that require a debian system
would be all that's required.  This hasn't been tested yet, but if the scripts are written in
python, much of this could be merged into the paella code, and support for other distributions
would then be a reality, instead of a hack.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactor-the-code">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Refactor the Code</a></h1>
<p>I have tried, from the beginning, to make all the code as modular as possible.  One of my
general rules of thumb is that a function or method should be contained within one page
of a text editor (although I allow for excessive comments to exceed this limit).  This means
that a long function is usually broken up into meaningful components.  While this makes it
easier to keep each function or method accurate and correct, it also can make things
confusing if you don't keep a consistent naming policy.  For example, in the code, I have
been using the terms &quot;variables&quot; and &quot;environment&quot; almost interchangeably.  This creates
a good bit of confusion in determining what's going on with the code.  I know this generates
confusion, because I wrote the code and I frequently get confused when I have to dig deep
into it.</p>
<p>The code for paella (and useless) has been written from a time when I was just beginning to
learn python, to the present, where I'm still have only an intermediate understanding of the
language.  As a result, some of the code is semantically better than other parts.  In order to
keep from introducing new bugs, I have refrained from dramatically reworking some parts
of the code.  I have also written some vestigial methods and functions that are never called,
thinking that I may need to use them one day, but never needing them.  Sometimes, there's
a duplication of code or functionality when I forget that I've written some code that takes care
of something, and write something mostly equivalent in another place.</p>
<p>I am thinking about scrapping the db and sqlgen packages from useless, and moving to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">sqlalchemy</a> for the database code.  SQLAlchemy didn't exist when I started paella, and
it's ancestor, SQLObject, was still in its infancy.  As a result, I had to create my own
database code, but I couldn't concentrate entirely on that area, as I've had other things to
do.  Since there is somebody else concentrating on this entirely, I think that it's time to
move the code in that direction.</p>
