<h1>Original gui design goals</h1>
<p>The original goals for the gui were to provide enough of an interface to the <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de">paella</a>
database to do simple operations needed to create traits and their components.
Much of the gui was made without regard for new users, or users unfamiliar with
the code or paella system.  Most of my time spent in developing paella has been focused
on the installer code, and in system design.  It can take a great deal of time in
testing, troubleshooting problems and improving systems.  As a result, the gui is
very minimalistic, and will not do all (although it will do most) necessary operations
needed to make use of the database.</p>

<div class="section" id="gtk-qt-and-gnome-kde">
<h1>Gtk/Qt and Gnome/KDE</h1>
<p>There are two graphical management interfaces for paella.  One is written
using <a class="reference external" href="http://pygtk.org">pygtk</a>.  The other is written  using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pykde/index.php">pykde</a>.  I started paella writing the
pygtk interface, but during the end of 2004, I switched to developing with the
pykde interface.</p>
<p>Way back when I was using python1.5, I learned to write interfaces with pygtk.  At the
time the qt license was not <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">dfsg</a> compatible, but gtk was.  By the time I got around
to writing paella, I had plenty of inertia with pygtk, although there was a dfsg compatible
qt available.</p>
<p>I decided to play around with pykde one day and found it a little easier than gtk.  It takes
longer for me to write with pykde currently, because my relative exposure to when
compared to pygtk.  I am expecting that to change with time and practice. One of the
things that attracted me to pykde is the lower level widget subclasses.  I haven't used
to much of pygnome because of it's poor widget selection, and the difficutly in using
bonobo.  There don't seem to be many lowlevel replacements for gtk widgets that are
gnome aware.  To be fair, at the time the pygnome docs weren't fulfilling, so I may have
missed out on something I didn't know about.  One example that I am thinking of is the
KComboBox which is a QComboBox with text completion methods and configurable
hotkeys.</p>

<div class="section" id="current-state-of-paella-gui">
<h1>Current State of Paella Gui</h1>
<p>Currently, the gtk interface is completely deprecated, and the kde interface is being
actively developed.  Most of the necessary functionality required to manage the
paella database is implemented in the gui.  This does not mean that the gui is as
functional as desired, but it is functional enough to do most of what is required.  A
<a class="reference external" href="guide.html">guide</a> has been written explaining how to use the paella-managment gui.</p>
