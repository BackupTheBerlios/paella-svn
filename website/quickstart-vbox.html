<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Introduction</a></h2>
<!-- introductory comment -->
<p>Paella depends on a particular type of setup to operate.  This document details how to
bootstrap that setup, starting from the bare minimum requirements.  This guide is written
with the goal of minimizing the requirement for the root account to setup the system.  The
former method of working with paella, required (possibly) extensive configuring of a local
network.  In order to effectively use paella in a &quot;production&quot; environment, where you are
actually installing machines, still requires the same type of network configuration.  It is hoped
that the method outlined here can help prepare this by using paella to generate the
configuration that paella requires.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Requirements</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="debian">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Debian</a></h2>
<p>You should be running debian to follow this quickstart procedure.  It's technically not
required, but this document will assume that your running either lenny, sid, or etch
with VirtualBox running (from backports.org or similar).  This procedure has been tested
while running sid, although lenny should work just fine.  There also shouldn't really be
any problem with using etch, save for having to have VirtualBox installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Hardware</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart routine was developed and tested using a laptop with 3GB of memory.
You could probably get by with less which I will try to estimate later.  Most of the memory
is required to run the virtual machines.  I estimate that only 2GB of ram will be required.
Please note that this is only the hardware requirements for following this quickstart
procedure, and doesn't reflect the actual requirements to run paella in a regular
environment with a network of machines.</p>
<p>You will need to run an operating system that can host VirtualBox OSE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualbox-ose">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">VirtualBox OSE</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart will use VirtualBox OSE to setup the machine that will act as the main
paella server, and also to test to make machines to test the installs.  The procedure outlined
below is assuming that you are using a GNU/Linux system as a host for VirtualBox OSE, but
there shouldn't be anything stopping somebody from using VirtualBox  on another host OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-netinst-cd-image-lennybeta2">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Debian Netinst CD Image (LennyBeta2)</a></h2>
<p>The upcoming lenny release is what is currently supported.  You should get the netinst iso,
which available on this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">page</a>.  I used the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/lenny_di_beta2/i386/iso-cd/debian-LennyBeta2-i386-netinst.iso">i386</a> image.  Hopefully any architecture should work,
but at the moment, only i386 is tested.  When I'm satisfied that the i386 is working properly, I'll
be testing the amd64 architecture.  Feedback on any other architectures would be appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remaster-the-netinst-iso">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Remaster the netinst iso</a></h2>
<p>This step is optional, but it may be handy, especially if you have an application that can remaster
an iso image.  This allows you to preseed the debian installer and make an automated install.
Even though this step is technically optional, it would be a very good idea to get the script below,
and the files that are obtained through subversion in the script to get an idea of how to proceed
manually without performing this step.  This step is highly recommended</p>
<p>If you are running debian, remastering the iso is easy:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p><strong>WARNING!!!</strong>  This script uses sudo to perform the loopback mounting of the iso
image.  Be sure to look over the script really good before you execute it.  You may want to
change the ARCH variable near the top of the file.  Be sure that you have rsync, sudo, and
subversion installed.</p>
<p>Either download the iso, and enter the filename as the first argument, or just run the script
without arguments.  The script will download the debian-LennyBeta2-i386-netinst.iso for you.</p>
<p>The script will give you a chance to review and edit the preseed files before you create the
remastered iso image.  When the script is finished, the iso image will be ./paella-netinst.iso .</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Setup the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<p>You need to get the virtualbox frontend up and running.</p>
<p>Make a new machine using the wizard provided by the virtualbox frontend.  Press next
and name the machine &quot;paella&quot;.  Select &quot;Debian&quot; for the OS type.  Press next.  Set the base
memory size to 512MB.  Press next.  Make a new disk image at the default 8GB size (I chose
dynamically expanding size).  Press finish.</p>
<p>Select paella from the list of machines on the frontend, and click the settings button.  In the
configuration dialog, select CD/DVD-ROM on the left hand side.  Click on the Mount CD/DVD
Drive button at the top.  Select the ISO Image File.  Press the folder on the right to bring up
the Virtual Disk Manager.  Here you want to add the netinst iso that you downloaded.  Close
the Virtual Disk Manager, and make sure that the iso is selected as the image file that will
be mounted.</p>
<p>Now, select the Network part of the list of the left hand side of the settings dialog.  By default,
the network adapter should be enabled, and set to NAT.  This is what we want.  We also want
to add another network interface to this machine, so select the Adapter 1 tab.  Click the
&quot;Enable Network Adapter&quot; button.  Make sure the &quot;Attached to&quot; selection is set to &quot;Internal
Network&quot;.  You will need to name the network in the field that says &quot;Network Name&quot;.  Any name
should do just fine.  I used &quot;lapnet&quot; (no quotes), since I'm on a laptop.  Remember this name,
since you'll need this for the other machine(s) that you will use paella to install to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boot-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Boot the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<p>Now you should be ready to boot the virtual machine, and install debian lenny.</p>
<p>Boot the machine by pressing Start (the green arrow) on the virtualbox frontend (make sure
the paella virtual machine is the one that's selected).  When the boot screen appears, select
one of the first two menu options.  Don't bother selecting the second option unless you have
a local debian mirror, and you have modified the preseed files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-paella-from-subversion">

<div class="section" id="install-subversion">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Install Subversion</a></h2>
<p>You will need to install subversion to setup the environment necessary to run paella.
As root:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
apt-get install subversion
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obtain-the-quick-setup-script">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Obtain the quick setup script</a></h2>
<p>type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/paella-devel-quick-setup
</pre>
<p>This file should already be executable, if not, do chmod +x paella-devel-quick-setup.</p>
<p>You should edit the file and change the variables at the top to your needs.  When you are
ready, run the script, install the packages, and make the changes to your .bashrc .  If you
don't want to make the changes to your .bashrc, you can put the lines in another file that
you will have to source before running any of the scripts.  There is such a file, called
paella_environment that is created for you when you run the script.</p>
<p>If you change any of the variables, make a copy of the script first. Keep in mind that throughout
this guide I will be referencing things according to the default configuration provided.</p>

<div class="section" id="build-paella-packages-from-source-tree">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Build paella packages from source tree</a></h1>
<p>You may wish to go ahead and build debian packages from the source tree.  If you do this, you
will also have to build the <a class="reference external" href="http://useless.berlios.de/">useless</a> packages.  Going this route has the advantage of keeping
you from having possibly modify your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="setup-database-server">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Setup Database Server</a></h1>
<p>Paella is developed and used with postgresql version 8.3.  It may work with newer versions, but
it is not tested.  It is recommended that you run the database server on a host on your local
network instead of the host you'll be using paella on.  This is not necessary, but it does help
the performance quite a bit.</p>
<p>If you are new to using postgresql, I suggest reading
/usr/share/doc/postgresql-8.3/README.Debian.gz first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steps to setup paella database:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
apt-get install postgresql
su postgres
createuser -sdr dbadmin
createuser -SDR paella
exit
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, you will have to edit a couple of configuration files as the postgres user.</p>
<div class="section" id="edit-postgresql-conf">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Edit postgresql.conf</a></h2>
<p>You will probably have to edit /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/postgresql.conf , and
set &quot;tcpip_socket = true&quot; .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-pg-hba-conf">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Edit pg_hba.conf</a></h2>
<p>You will have to edit /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/pg_hba.conf, and add some lines:</p>
<p>If your database server is not on your desktop, but on the local network, you
will have to allow access to the paella database from your machine.
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#TYPE   DATABASE        USER            IP-ADDRESS      IP-MASK         METHOD
host    paella          paella          &lt;my ip address&gt; 255.255.255.255 trust
host    paella          dbadmin         &lt;my ip address&gt; 255.255.255.255 ident sameuser
</pre>
<p>If your database server is on your desktop, you need to allow access from your uml network.
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#TYPE   DATABASE        USER            IP-ADDRESS      IP-MASK         METHOD
host    paella          paella          10.0.1.0                255.255.255.0   trust
host    paella          dbadmin         10.0.1.1                255.255.255.0   trust
</pre>
<p>There is no real authentication support, except for limited password support.  There has not
been enough reason to pursue this yet, as the database is always either developed or used in
a trusted environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dbusers">

<p>First off, you will need to get root and install a couple of packages:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-tap-network">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">Configure TAP Network</a></h2>
<p>Be sure to read /usr/share/doc/uml-utilities/README.Debian, and follow the instructions
there to setup the tap network.</p>
<p>This quick start procedure uses the 10.0.1.0 network for the user-mode-linux machines by
default.  Here is what to add to /etc/network/interfaces:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
auto tap0
iface tap0 inet static
      address 10.0.1.1
      netmask 255.255.255.0

</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="masquerade-tap-network">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">Masquerade TAP Network</a></h2>
<p>You will need to setup iptables to get your uml machines to access the rest of the network.

<pre class="literal-block">
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
echo '1' &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

<div class="section" id="setup-paellarc">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">Setup .paellarc</a></h2>
<p>If you used the quick setup script above, the example paellarc file will be here,
~/workspace/paella/config/share/paellarc .  You can copy this file to ~/.paellarc and edit it.
If you are not familiar with the file format, you can read about it <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html">here</a> .  Options that are
prefixed by an underscore are not referenced in the code.  You can make your own if you
wish.</p>
<p>In the database section, the dbhost option should be the ip address of the tap interface you
created in the section above.  You will probably want to change the dbusername option to
the database admin user that you created above.</p>
<p>You can either ignore or completely remove the installer section.  It is only needed for the
paella machine installer.  It is not needed for the user-mode-linux installer which we are
using here.</p>
<p>The management_gui section has options for the paella-management application.  The options
that you may want to change here are &quot;text_editor&quot;, and &quot;x_differ&quot;.  Both of these commands
should display an X window.  For the x_differ, I highly recommend xxdiff.  The x_differ command
line conform to this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>You should not need to change any other options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-umlmachines-conf">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Setup .umlmachines.conf</a></h2>
<p>If you used the quick setup script above, the example umlmachines config file will be here,
~/workspace/paella/config/share/umlmachines.  If you built packages, install the
paella-uml-admin package, and you will find the file at
/usr/share/doc/paella-uml-admin/examples/umlmachines.conf .  You can copy this
file to ~/.umlmachines.conf and edit it.  The file format is the same as the paellarc file.
Reading through this file can give you a good idea of how the paella uml system works.</p>
<p>The top of the file is where most of the paths are defined.  You shouldn't have to change these
if you are using the quick setup script, although you will probably need to modify the
<strong>uml_initscript</strong> option to point to the correct location of the paella-init file.  This
is the option with the value &quot;%(_script_path)s/paella-init&quot; , and has a comment above it for
working from the source tree.  Simply uncomment this option, and comment out the option
for the default location right below it.</p>
<p>If you are not using the default tap network described above, you will have to modify the uml
network options accordingly.</p>
<p>You may want to modify the <strong>bootstrap_debmirror</strong> option in the
<cite>umlmachines</cite> section, if you already have a debian mirror that you can run
debootstrap from.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Using paella-management</a></h1>
<p>You should be ready to use the paella-management PyKDE interface now.  Before running
the application, check the <strong>management_gui</strong> section of your ~/.paellarc file,
and make sure that both the <strong>text_editor</strong> and <strong>x_differ</strong> options
are set to applications that exist on your system and work in X windows.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-paella-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Start paella-management</a></h2>
<p>Run the paella-management script to start the management interface.  The first thing that you
will want to do is to connect to the database.  There is a connect button on the toolbar for you
to press.  The connection dialog entries are taken from your ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p>Once you connect to the database, you should get a dialog asking to create the primary
tables.  You should click yes here to setup an empty database structure.  If you don't do
this, the database import procedure will create these tables for you, but you won't be able to
use the paella-management interface until you do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-stage1-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Import stage1 database</a></h2>
<p>Now we are going to import the startup database.  You will need an internet connection to
import the database.  The importer downloads the Packages files from the debian mirror in
the database.xml file, and inserts them into the database.  Go to the menubar, and in the
database menu, select &quot;import database&quot;.  A directory selection dialog will appear.  You
need to select the &quot;stage1&quot; directory.  Note that the default debian mirror is
<a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian</a> .  If you need to change this, edit the database.xml file
in the stage1 directory, and alter the uri attribute to the aptsource xml element at the
top of the file.  You can change this to a local mirror if you already have one.  Paella has only
been tested with http apt sources, it's behaviour on other methods is unknown.</p>
<blockquote>
If you are working from a subversion copy from the quick setup script, the directory
you will want to select is here, ~/workspace/paella/config/share/databases/stage1/ .</blockquote>
<p>If everything is working, you should be seeing an ugly little progress dialog displaying
something resembling what it should be doing.  The packages will probably take a little
while to insert.  The apt_source_packages table can take a lot of space that could be
better saved.  In the future, it will probably default to only holding package names rather
than the other attributes in the Packages file.  The reason they are there is to help keep the
automated installations from bombing due to unavailable or misspelled packages.</p>
<p>After importing the database, you will have to disconnect and then reconnect to the
database to refresh the available widgets in the paella-management application.  You may
wish to restart the application instead, as when an import occurs, a lot of memory is used
to parse the Packages file, and insert the packages into the database.  This memory is not
freed after the import process.  Fixing this has not been a major goal, as imports are fairly
rare during the normal use of paella-management.</p>

<p>Now we should be ready to install the uml machines.  The uml installer is currently limited to
installing one machine at a time.  This is due to the default configuration for this quickstart
guide using a static ip.  This can be easily changed later if you wish to use the uml installer
for testing purposes.</p>

having to use a full debian mirror, that used to be required previously to use paella.  This
partial mirror should be under 400MB in size.</p>

<p>This will run a script that will prepare pbuilder to build the paella and useless packages.
Basically it either generates or restores the base.tgz for pbuilder.  The base.tgz is copied to
the hostfs mount, in case it is needed in the future.  Once the script finishes, the next step
is to get the useless and paella packages built.  There is a script that does this too.
type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./build_paella_from_subversion
</pre>
<p>This script will checkout the sources from subversion.  It then exports the working copies and
uses pbuilder to build the exports.  Once the packages are built, they are uploaded to
the uml_head machine, and placed in the debian mirror.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id39">Getting started with paella (outdated)</a></h1>
<p>People who will get the most benefit out of paella are IT consultants that manage
multiple disjoint networks.  You may also benefit from it if your network is large enough,
and you have mostly debian machines on it.  If you only maintain one network with a few
machines, e.g. a firewall, a server, and a couple of desktops, the time involved it setting up
paella and maintaining configurations might probably be more than just using more simple
backup and restore methods.</p>
<p>There are currently no real releases of paella, because i dislike the file release system at
berlios, so you will have to check out the code via subversion, or alternately you can grab
the debian packages from <a class="reference external" href="http://gregscomputerservice.com">http://gregscomputerservice.com</a>.  The line for the sources.list
is 'deb <a class="reference external" href="http://gregscomputerservice.com/debian/local">http://gregscomputerservice.com/debian/local</a> common/'.</p>
<p>A person who uses paella is expected to understand how to perform basic system
administration on a debian system.  They should also be comfortable with building their
own debian packages from source, and debianizing a generic source application.  Paella
makes use of mini-dinstall to maintain a local mini-repository and can install systems that
reference that repository.  This provides a fairly simple way to add custom packages to the
systems that you will be designing.</p>
<p>If you feel that you may benefit out of paella, here is how to get started.  If you don't want to
use the apt source above, you can check it out from subversion at berlios.  Paella
depends on Useless.  Useless is a collection of python modules that I use in other database
applications.</p>
<p>to get useless:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless</p>
<p>to get paella:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk paella</p>
<p>You can build the packages with debuild, or fakeroot debian/rules binary.</p>

<div class="section" id="hardware-recommendations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id40">Hardware Recommendations</a></h2>
<p>Since the paella-nfsinstaller runs on a nfsroot, it is necessary to have some sort of network
to support this.  Paella works best with at least one dedicated server and a management
desktop, both running debian.</p>
<p>Server:</p>
<p>The server will be responsible for running the nfs-server, the boot-server, the postgresql
server, and the webserver. It is recommended that you have a local mirror of a debian
repository on the server, and have it accessible over http.  You should also install the
paella-debrepos package on this machine to create and maintain your custom debian
repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Database Setup:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
apt-get install postgresql
su postgres
createuser -a -d adminuser
createuser -A -D paella
createlang plpgsql template1
exit
su adminuser createdb paella
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You should setup /etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf to allow access to the database by
paella from anywhere on the local network, and allow adminuser from your management
desktop.</p>
<p>The setup of the boot-server and the nfs-server are beyond the scope of this
document, but the profiles are defined in the default database provided with paella.  So
instead of taking the time to setup the boot-server and nfs-server manually, you can use the
paella-chroot-install script to create the machine and tar it up.</p>
<p>Desktop:</p>
<p>The desktop should be about 400MHz Pentium or better with &gt;= 1024x768 resolution,
capable of running kde.  It is necessary to have access to your database on the server.  You
should also have your EDITOR environment variable set to something that will pop-up
a window in X.  On this machine you will want to install the paella-admin and the
paella-defaultdb packages.  The default config file is located at /etc/paellarc.  You will
probably want to copy this to ~/.paellarc and edit it.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="local-debian-repository">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">Local Debian Repository</a></h2>
<p>Paella is built to make use of you local debian repository.  The paella-debrepos package
uses (and depends on) mini-dinstall.  If you haven't used mini-dinstall, you should review
the documentation for it.  Install the paella-debrepos package on the server.  The init script
should fail because you are likely not to have a debrepos user.  This will be fixed later.
Anyway, in the root of the debian mirror, there needs to be a 'local' directory.  The
mini-dinstall daemon will be run from here. In the 'local' directory there needs to be a
directory for each suite you have in paella, plus one called 'common'.</p>

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">Using Paella-Management</a></h2>
<p>The management interface is going through changes.  Paella started with a gtk interface,
and as time passed, the qt/kde toolkit started looking more appealing.  As a result, the
gtk interface works, but it is sloppy, and not going to be fixed.  The kde interface won't do
very much right now, but bugs will be fixed on it.  A good portion of setting up and
configuring the machines is done with the gtk interface, so for the time being, anybody
using paella will have to bear through using it until the kde interface is ready.</p>
