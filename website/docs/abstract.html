<p>Paella is system for creating/installing customized debian systems.
There are no current plans for configuration updates on live systems,
that's not it's initial purpose, although it may be extended later.</p>
<p>Inspiration for paella comes from many places:</p>
<div class="section" id="fai">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">FAI</a></h1>
<p>FAI (the fully automated installer)
An excellent installer, with the capability of bootstrapping
an entire network!  paella was going to just complement fai,
ut I'm starting to prefer the configuration layout i'm planning,
so paella will probably completely replace fai.</p>
<p>Much of this has been
done, and now only the setup-storage command is being used
from the fai-client package.  There is no need to reinvent the
wheel here, as setting up disks can be complex and error
proned if it's not managed right</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debconf">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">debconf</a></h1>
<p>an important abstract configuration system</p>
<p>Much of the inspiration for paella comes straight from both
debconf and FAI.  I wanted to make a system that held the
configuration for many packages in many formats and be
able to use an automated installer to install the configuration
onto systems.  Also, I wanted to keep the management of
the configuration separate from the system it was being
installed to, to keep the system from depending on paella.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="knoppix">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Knoppix</a></h1>
<p>,,, and Morphix, Gnoppix, and other live cd's</p>
<p>Debian Live has made most of the live cd's obsolete, and it's
now the preferred method of creating a live system.  It's
planned to be able to use paella to generate the chroot directory
hen use debian live to build the binary image.  This hasn't been
done yet, but it should not be too difficult.  Since debian live can
make live systems on many media types, including network
images, it's now being used for the paella installer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demudi-debian-lex">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Demudi, Debian-Lex, ...</a></h1>
<p>I think paella can be very instrumental in helping configure and
install a custom network on a per network type basis, (i.e. what
machines are on the network and what are there jobs, expected
activities, etc.  I am also thinking of networks with custom configured
roaming pda's, laptops, or whatever can take a debian system.</p>
<p>The paragraph above was written long ago, and now there are
custom debian distribution packages that help make this easier.
I think that paella could still be useful here, but I have not really
looked at the cdd package very much.  Much of the reason for
paella's existence is to make it easier to make machines that
are configured to perform special sets of tasks.</p>
