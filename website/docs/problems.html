<p>This page details problems with paella that are planned to be fixed at some
point in the future.  Be sure to also read the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page, as the problem you
are experiencing may be listed there.  Generally, the items on the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page
are not so much problems or bugs as they are an explanation of the behavior
of paella, what to expect, and what's required when using it.  There may be a
couple of items on the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page that could be considered problems, but I'm
not listing them here, until I can determine a good course of action to resolve
them.  I welcome input on what should be done about both the items here and on
the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page.</p>

but not sloppy :) )</li>

<p>There are a lot of unimplemented features in the gui.  There are also features
that don't work appropriately.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>templates in the traits are tied to packages <strong>fixed</strong></li>
<li>current_environment should look more like default_environment<ul>
<li>changing this will require some changes to the code.  Either the
changes will be extensive, or they will be minor, and scattered throughout
the code.</li>

<div class="section" id="circular-dependencies">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">circular dependencies</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the traits, families, and machines all have parents, and there is
no code to check on whether there is a circular relationship among
these entities.  Fixing this problem is a low priority for me.  The
administrator who makes the paella database should be aware of
how the entities relate to each other.  If there are times when the
install or parts of the management interface seem to stall, and
there's a python process using all the cpu, this is probably the reason.
I'm open to accepting patches from people who wish to have this
problem fixed, especially since it might become more difficult to tell
that a circular dependency exists as the database grows in size and
complexity.  These problems can probably be easily fixed by using
the kjbuckets graph class that's already being used in paella.  I just
haven't gotten around to doing this, and probably won't until I start
experiencing problems here.</li>
<li>due to the way the variables are substituted, there is also the chance
that a circular dependency can occur here.  This problem will be harder
to detect, and therefore, harder to prevent in the code.  Also, as the
database increases in size and complexity, it's more likely that a
circular dependency will happen here, rather than in the objects above.
I'm open to suggestions on how this problem can be both spotted and
fixed.</li>
</ul>
