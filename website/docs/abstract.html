<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Paella is system for creating/installing customized debian systems.
There are no current plans for configuration updates on live systems,
that's not it's initial purpose, although it may be extended later.</p>
<p>Paella differs from other automated installation system by using a
PostgreSQL database to store all of the configuration.  PostgreSQL was
chosen primarily because it supports foreign keys and stored procedures.
Foreign keys are used to keep the relationships in the configuation tied
together, and this can be useful for maintaining a configuation over a long
time as it helps to keep it from breaking due to broken relationships between
the different parts of the configuration.  This doesn't make it impossible to
make a broken configuration, or to break a good configuration, but it does
help quite a bit.  It also helps organize the configuration so that it is easier to
tell what is going to be installed and configured.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inspiration">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Inspiration</a></h1>
<p>Inspiration for paella comes from many places.  Since inspiration is
what it is, please note that the following sections were written quite a few
years ago.  While the inspiration hasn't really changed much, the focus of
development has changed to match and make use of the improvements
and additions that have occured in the software community since paella
was started.</p>
<div class="section" id="fai">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">FAI</a></h2>
<p>FAI (the fully automated installer)
An excellent installer, with the capability of bootstrapping
an entire network!  paella was going to just complement fai,
but I'm starting to prefer the configuration layout i'm planning,
so paella will probably completely replace fai.</p>
<p>Much of this has been done, and now only the setup-storage
command is being used from the fai-client package.  There is
no need to reinvent the wheel here, as setting up disks can
be complex and error proned if it's not managed right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debconf">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Debconf</a></h2>
<p>Debconf is an important abstract configuration system.</p>
<p>Much of the inspiration for paella comes straight from both
debconf and FAI.  I wanted to make a system that held the
configuration for many packages in many formats and be
able to use an automated installer to install the configuration
onto systems.  Also, I wanted to keep the management of
the configuration separate from the system it was being
installed to, to keep the system from depending on paella.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="knoppix">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Knoppix</a></h2>
<p>,,, and Morphix, Gnoppix, and other live cd's</p>
<p>Debian Live has made most of the live cd's obsolete, and it's
now the preferred method of creating a live system.  It's
planned to be able to use paella to generate the chroot directory
then use debian live to build the binary image.  This has been
done, and it is fairly simple.  The basic method of doing this is
performed in the <a class="reference external" href="quickstart-vbox.html">quickstart</a> guide.  Since debian live can
make live systems on many media types, including network
images, it's now being used for the paella installer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demudi-debian-lex">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Demudi, Debian-Lex, ...</a></h2>
<p>I think paella can be very instrumental in helping configure and
install a custom network on a per network type basis, (i.e. what
machines are on the network and what are there jobs, expected
activities, etc.  I am also thinking of networks with custom configured
roaming pda's, laptops, or whatever can take a debian system.</p>
<p>The paragraph above was written long ago, and now there are
custom debian distribution packages that help make this easier.
I think that paella could still be useful here, but I have not really
looked at the cdd package very much.  Much of the reason for
paella's existence is to make it easier to make machines that
are configured to perform special sets of tasks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-principles">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Design Principles</a></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, there was some thought behind how a configuration for
a newly installed machine should be structured.  I have been guided by
ideas that I like, and also by some ideas that I didn't like.  I have tried to
express those ideas, the best I could, into the design of paella.  Due to
time constraints, and effort required to implement some of those ideas,
I couldn't effectively express some of them, but I have focused on the
ideas that I felt were the most important.</p>
<div class="section" id="one-location-for-a-variable">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">One Location for a Variable</a></h2>
<p>One of the most tiresome activities in setting up a new system is the
repetition of some parts of the configuration.  This is probably most
evident when entering ip addresses, netmasks, and similar info into
the many configuration files that a system has.  I have designed paella
to keep this repetition down to a minimum.  Theoretically, there should
be only one place where a variable should reside, and anything needing
the value of that variable would retrieve it from that one place.  I have
come very close to accomplishing this, with only a few exceptions (and
most of those exceptions are due to being in a hurry, not from any
technical limitations).</p>
<p>Let's look at an example, using hostnames.  I will use the part of the
localnet trait to demonstrate.  Suppose you are installing a server
for a small business, and it's a hard sell, so you can only sell one
server.  For starters, you make this server a firewall/router/fileserver.
Let's look a sampling of the variables:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
global:hostname = strawberry
localnet:mainserver = &lt;--|global:hostname|--&gt;
localnet:file_server = &lt;--|localnet:mainserver|--&gt;
localnet:samba_server = &lt;--|localnet:file_server|--&gt;
localnet:nfs_server = &lt;--|localnet:file_server|--&gt;
</pre>
<p>Now imagine a similar place with two servers, one acting as the
firewall/router, and another acting as the file server:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
localnet:mainserver = strawberry
localnet:file_server = mango
localnet:samba_server = &lt;--|localnet:file_server|--&gt;
localnet:nfs_server = &lt;--|localnet:file_server|--&gt;

strawberry global:hostname = &lt;--|localnet:mainserver|--&gt;
mango global:hostname = &lt;--|localnet:file_server|--&gt;
</pre>
<p>Actually setting the configuration is a bit more involved than this, as
I have neglected to mention dns, dhcp, and other things, but I merely
want to illustrate a point.  The localnet variables would be in a family,
and that family would be attached to the mango and strawberry
machines.  The global:hostname variables would be attached to each
machine.  Using the variables this way also helps to keep the purpose
of the variable known, as we can see that the hostname for mango is
set to the fileserver for the local network.</p>
<p>(The databases that ship with paella are only examples.  Feel free to
make a configuration that makes more sense to you.  I have tried to
make paella very flexible.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separation-of-the-logical-system-and-the-physical-system">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Separation of the Logical System and the Physical System</a></h2>
<p>I have tried to structure the objects in the paella database to make it
easy to distinguish from a logical system that performs it jobs, and
the machine where it is installed.  I haven't made anything that actually
enforces the separation, so it is up to the administrator to decide what
belongs to a logical system, and what belongs to a physical system.</p>
<p>Here is a quick rundown:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Traits</strong>: Traits are the smallest component indicating a &quot;feature&quot;.  They can be
either logical, physical, or both.  The variables used in a trait can be physical or
logical, and you would use families to divide them.</li>
<li><strong>Profiles</strong>:  Profiles are the ordered collection of traits to be installed, and the
famillies of configuration values that will be applied to it.  This is meant to
represent a logical system, so you can install a profile to different machines.</li>
<li><strong>Families</strong>:  Families are a collection of variables.  They can be physical or
logical, but they shouldn't be both.  You attach logical families to a profile, and
physical families to a machine.</li>
<li><strong>Machines</strong>:  Machines are meant to represent the physical host that a profile
will be installed on.  The variables for a machine should be physical.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the terms &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; are made generally, and aren't
to be taken too literally.  For example, I usually attach the hostname variable
to a machine, although it's not as &quot;physical&quot; as a mac address, or video
driver.  The idea behind this is to separate the variables that can be used on
any machine, from the variables that are only useful to one machine, or a
set of machines.</p>
