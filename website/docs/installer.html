<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Base Processor</a></h2>
<p>This is the base class of all the installer objects.  This class isn't meant to
be instantiated on it's own, but to be subclassed.  This class has four main
attributes; _processes, _process_map, current, and log.  Hereafter, I'll refer
to the _processes member as processes, and the _process_map member
as process_map.  The current attribute contains the name of the process
that's currently being processed.  The log attribute is an instance of the
python logging module, and it's expected to be defined in a subclass.</p>
<p>The processes attribute is a list of the steps that will be processed, in order.
The process_map attribute is a python dictionary mapping the name of the
process (in processes) to the function or method that will be run.  This
function or method takes no arguments.  Any process that's in the list, but
not in the process_map will be skipped.</p>
<p>Before any process is processed, the make_script method is called, with the
process name as an argument.  This method will either return None, or it will
return the path to a script to be executed in place of the process.  This step is
done before checking the process_map to see if it's mapped to a method or
function.  This enables a script to run in place of a process that would normally
be skipped.</p>
<p>There are also two special method that can be implemented in a subclass.
These are named &quot;pre_process&quot; and &quot;post_process&quot;.  They take the name
of the process as an argument, and can be used to do things before and/or
after the process in processed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="base-installer">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Base Installer</a></h2>
<p>This is the base installer object, and is a subclass of BaseProcessor.  Like
the BaseProcessor, this class is also not meant to be instantiated on its own,
but to be subclassed.  This class holds attributes and methods that are in
common with all the installer objects.  These are described briefly below.  Not
all of them are described, but only the more important ones.</p>
<div class="section" id="important-attributes">

<li>This attribute is the instance of a child installer, if the installer has a
child installer.  This is how the installers are stacked onto one another.
Generally, there is an &quot;install&quot; process in the parent installer that will
be used to run all the processes in the child installer.</li>

<div class="section" id="trait-installer">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Trait Installer</a></h2>
<p>This is the most basic of the installer objects, and it's the object that does
most of the work.  This object doesn't exist by itself, but is an attribute of
the profile installer object.  This object will process a trait, but it won't check
to see if a parent trait has already been processed.  It's probably possible
to use this object on it's own in a script to dynamically process traits during
the install process, but this hasn't been attempted yet.</p>
<p>The trait processes can be overridden by inserting a comma separated
list of processes in the default environment under the section <strong>installer</strong>,
with the option named <strong>trait_processes</strong>.  This can be valuable if you want
to see how a system is without templates, or without scripts being run.  In this
case you would set <strong>trait_processes</strong> to  &quot;remove, install&quot; and the other
processes will be skipped.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Profile Installer</a></h2>
<p>The profile installer isn't used alone, but is and attribute of either
the chroot installer or the machine installer.</p>
<p>The profile installer is responsible for getting the traits processed.  The
list of traits contained in the profile is expanded to make an ordered list
that includes the parents of the traits.  Then that list of traits becomes
the list of processes for the profile installer.  The profile installer then
calls the trait installer to process each trait in the expanded list.</p>
<p>The profile installer also creates a directory in target called /root/paella ,
and uses this directory to store information about the install.  The list of
traits to be installed, and a list of currently installed traits are placed in
this directory.</p>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Processes</a></h3>
<p>The list of processes is the list of traits to be installed.  While it's possible
to hook a trait with a script, it's not implemented, and there's no table in
the database to hold the script.  The ability to skip or modify a trait would
probably be useful, so this might be implemented in the future.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chroot-installer">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Chroot Installer</a></h2>
<p>The chroot installer is probably the most important installer, as it is
the installer that actually installs the profile to the target.  It has a lot
of processes that happen both before and after installing the profile.
It's responsible for creating the target directory, if it doesn't exist.  It's
also responsible for bootstrapping the base system, using either
debootstrap or a premade tarball. It's responsible for mounting and
unmounting  pseudo filesystems, such as /proc and /sys.  And it's
also responsible for various things that need to be done in order
to prepare for the profile to be installed, and clean up after.</p>
<p>The chroot installer can be used on it's own to install a profile to
a target directory.  This is a good way to create a customized
chroot system, or to install a chroot profile while installing a
machine.  Currently, the processes can't be overridden when just
the chroot installer is being used.  These processes are inherited
by the machine installer, and hook scripts can be made there.</p>
<p>If you really need to hook a process in the chroot installer, you
should make a &quot;chroot machine&quot; that skips the formatting of
the disks and installing the kernel, and use the machine installer
to install the profile in a target directory.</p>

it a machine name argument, and the machine will be recognized by the
paella database.  It will use the mac addresses of each ethernet interface
attached to the machine to identify it.</p>
