things done to database for testing
--------------------------------------------------

- stuff to fix later, when more code is up to date

removed kudzu, only test with sarge and desksarge
	put kudzu back in teporarily to fix missing trait problems

problems with importing Packages files into the database
	problem seems to be blank lines in description field
	workaround now is to remove those packages from the traits
	and fix the culprit later

	traits to fix when the problem is solved:
		pyca - default trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - hqgames trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - xgames trait - sarge, desksarge, kudzu

		freecraft - xgames trait - kudzu
		
		cantus - media_tools - kudzu

problems with missing traits that are present in kudzu
	 
- families
	  
 - removed admin_password variable from insecure 

 - trait webmin only in kudzu
	    
- profiles
 
 - ume_graphics only in kudzu
