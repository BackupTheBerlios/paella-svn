<div class="section" id="apt-source">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Apt Source</a></h1>
<p>An apt source is similar to a line in an /etc/apt/sources.list file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="suite">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Suite</a></h1>
<p>A suite is a similiar to debian suites like woody or sarge.  A suite
can be used to make different versions of configurations, or different
styles of design and configurations.  Traits are held in suites.</p>
<p>Basically a suite is an ordered list of apt sources, and a set of traits.  The first
apt source that is listed will be the repository that debootstrap will be run against.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trait">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Trait</a></h1>
<p>A trait is an atomic unit that signifies a feature.
A trait belongs to a suite.  The table in the database that holds the list of traits
is called $(suite)_traits.  A trait can have packages, parents, templates, scripts
and a set of variables.</p>
<div class="section" id="parents">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Parents</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>no trait can be processed during the installation before all
of its parents are processed.</li>
<li>parents are not required, but most traits should depend on a default
trait.</li>
<li>no trait can be processed during the installation before all of its
parents are processed.</li>

<div class="section" id="packages">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Packages</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>this is a list of packages to install or remove
- although other options are available, only install and remove are supported now</li>
<li>packages are not required</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="templates">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Templates</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>templates can have simple tags for variable substitution</li>
<li>templates store user/group and chmod permissions</li>
<li>currently the var/cache/debconf/config.dat template is reserved
for debconf (This approach is now deprecated, but not removed
from the code, if you really need a such a template, name it something
else, and rename it in the config script.)</li>
<li>if a template exists, called &quot;debconf&quot;, it will be processed with
debconf-set-selections during the preseed step in the trait installer.
This method is now used instead of the method using the debconf
config.dat template listed above.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Environment</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a collection of name, value pairs for use in the templates and scripts</li>
<li>a trait's environment contains its parents' environment</li>
<li>a big python dictionary is made of the environment where the keys
are formed as &quot;trait:name&quot; where trait is the trait and name is the
name of the variable.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scripts">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Scripts</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a trait is not required to have a script</li>
<li>the scripts that are currently supported are; pre, preseed, remove,
install, templates, config, chroot, reconfig, and post.<ul>
<li>chroot is a special script that is run in a chrooted environment in the target area.
This script should be aware of what's on the target system and only depend on
those things. The script shouldn't connect to paella or depend on other installation
tools not present in the target system.</li>
<li>the preseed, remove, install, templates, and reconfig scripts will override
the default process for the trait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-notes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Other Notes</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you can define a script for any
step in the trait install process.</li>
<li>if you make a script named install, remove, config,
or reconfig, that step in the trait process is ignored,
and the script run instead.  The script doesn't have
to do anything, so it's a good way to skip a step in the
trait installation</li>
<li>in order for a script to be executed its name must match
a step in the trait processes.</li>
<li>A script can be made in any language.  You only have to have the
interpreter for the script available on the installer system.  When using
a chroot script, the interpreter must be available on the target system.</li>

<p>A family is a collection of variables from different traits</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a family can have parents</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profile">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Profile</a></h1>
<p>A profile is a collection of traits, families, and variables.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li>Families - an unordered list of families</li>
<li>Variables<ul>
<li>the profile variables override the trait and family variables

</div>
<div class="section" id="machine-database">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Machine Database</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the machine database part of paella.  Profiles and traits should
not be machine specific.  Families should be either machine specific, or not machine
specific.  It may help for a machine specific family to depend on one that's not machine
specific.  The Machine database trying to be design to hold information about physical
systems to install logical systems from.</p>
<div class="section" id="machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Machine</a></h2>
<p>a machine contains</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a <strong>name</strong></li>
<li>a <strong>parent</strong> - This is a parent machine that current machine is based from.<ul>
<li>Unlike traits and families, a machine can only have one parent.</li>
<li>This is an optional field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a <strong>kernel</strong><ul>
<li>A kernel is simply the name of a kernel image package (for example,
linux-image-2.6-686).</li>
<li>The package must be install-able by apt, in a chroot environment, on the target system.</li>
<li>This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a <strong>diskconfig</strong><ul>
<li>a diskconfig is the name of a diskconfig file that will be used by setup-storage when
during the setup_disks part of the install.</li>
<li>This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a <strong>profile</strong> - This is the profile that will be installed on the machine.<ul>
<li>This attribute must be set somewhere in the machine's ancestry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>families</strong> - These are the normal families in the paella database.  These families
override the families in the profile.</li>
<li><strong>scripts</strong> - These are &quot;hook&quot; scripts to override steps in the install process.</li>
<li><strong>variables</strong> - These are variables that will override the variables defined in the
traits, families, profile, and families for the machine.  In other words, these are the
variables that override all other variables.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="machine-inheritance">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Machine Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Since machines can have parents, it's important to know how a parent affects the
machine.  There are three main attributes that each machine has.  These are the
kernel, profile, and diskconfig attributes.  If the child machine doesn't have one of
these attributes set, it is resolved by going up the ancestral chain until the attribute
is found.  So a kernel set on a parent machine will be installed on all the child machines,
unless one of the child machines has their kernel attribute set, which will override the
parent machine's kernel.  This allows the administrator to make groups of machines
by using a parent, setting the attributes on the parent, and leaving them as NULL on the
children.</p>
<p>Machine scripts are treated similarly to the attributes mentioned above.  A script set
on a parent machine will be run on each of the child machines, unless the child has
that script set itself.  There is currently not a way to tell a child machine to ignore a
parent's script and perform the regular step in the paella installer.</p>
<p>Families and variables are done differently.  Here, the variables are resolved from
&quot;oldest&quot; to &quot;youngest&quot;.  Each machine updates the variables with its families, then
its own variables.  If there is a parent family on a child machine that has a child family
on a parent machine, the parent family on the child machine will override the child
family on the parent machine.  This is because the variables are updated one machine
at a time from &quot;oldest&quot; to &quot;youngest&quot;, families first, then variables.</p>
<p>I'll put some examples here later, since this section is hard to write, and probably
even harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="machine-scripts">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Machine Scripts</a></h2>
<p>Machine scripts correspond to steps in the install process for machines.  These steps
will be treated similiar to the trait scripts. You may want to look at the <a class="reference external" href="installer.html">installer</a> page to
see how these step are arranged in the installers.  The default steps/scripts are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>pre<ul>
<li>This step normally does nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>setup_disks<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for partitioning the disks and
for creating the filesystems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ready_target<ul>
<li>This step makes sure the target directory exists before trying
to use it as a mount point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mount_target<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for mounting the filesystems
created in the previous step to the target directory.</li>
<li>The script will need to make the subdirectories in target
for filesystems under the target root, and mount the
appropriate ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bootstrap<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for bootstrapping the base
system into the target directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mount_target_proc<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for mounting /proc in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mount_target_sys<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for mounting /sys in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make_device_entries<ul>
<li>This step normally does nothing.  Before the arrival of udev,
this step used to run &quot;MAKEDEV generic&quot; (or extract a devices.tar
tarball) and add nodes for the target hard drive.  It is not needed
anymore, but remains in case udev can't do something that you
need to have done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mount_target_devpts<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for mounting /dev/pts in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>apt_sources_installer<ul>
<li>This step should create a sources.list file that is appropriate
for the installer environment.  It should place the file in
$target/etc/apt/sources.list .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ready_base_for_install<ul>
<li>This step copies the /etc/resolv.conf file from the installer system,
and runs &quot;apt-get -y update&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pre_install<ul>
<li>This step normally does nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>install<ul>
<li>This step performs the install process.  Replacing this step with a script
will bypass the profile installer and the traits.  This may be useful in certain
circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>post_install<ul>
<li>This step normally does nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>install_fstab<ul>
<li>This step is reponsible for installing the fstab on the target system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>install_modules<ul>
<li>This step should create a $target/etc/modules file appropriate for
the machine type.  This step isn't implemented anymore.  I'm leaving
the step here as a step that does nothing now, in case a script is
needed to perform this function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>install_kernel<ul>
<li>This step is reponsible for installing a kernel in the target and
preparing the bootloader for booting.</li>
<li>The machine should be ready to reboot after this step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>prepare_bootloader<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for installing the bootloader (grub) to the
target system, and configuring it to boot the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>apt_sources_final<ul>
<li>This step is reponsible for making a sources.list that will
be used when the machine is on the target site.  This step can be
skipped for on-site installations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>umount_target_proc<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for unmounting /proc in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>umount_target_sys<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for unmounting /sys in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>umount_target_devpts<ul>
<li>This step is responsible for unmounting /dev/pts in the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>post<ul>
<li>This step normally does nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
