What is Paella_?
---------------------

Paella_ is a installation/configuration management system centered on 
being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and 
networks.


Dependencies
--------------------

+ debian_  (Paella_ is meant to run on a debian system.  Currently only i386
  is able to be tested.)

  - most of paella can run on sarge, with the exception of the kde management
    interface.

+ useless_

  - useless_ is a set of python packages that provide a common set of code 
    for python applications I write.

+ python-kde3 and python-qtext

  - both of these should be easy to backport from sid.

  - parts of useless_ depend on this, and not paell-kde directly, but useless is split 
    to be able to use only what is needed.


Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain paella is through subversion.
