Paella
========

What is Paella_?
---------------------

Paella_ is a installation/configuration management system centered on 
being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and 
networks.

-----------------

What is Paella_ **Not**?
-------------------------------------

Paella is not a fully extensible installer that can work in a variety of 
environments.  The debian-installer works much better for a generic
installer.  Paella is meant to run on an nfsroot system, with access to
a postgresql database.  It can also install a system in a chroot environment.

Paella is not a full-fledged configuration system (yet), so far I have been mostly 
concerned with installation.  There is technically nothing preventing this.  With a good
design of traits and their scripts, it may be possible to just do a chroot reinstall on
the target system, and call it reconfigured.  The scripts in the default database are 
not written for that yet, but there is nothing in the paella framework keeping 
reconfiguration from happening with a reinstall.  Paella does provide a good way 
to handle cf files for cfengine.

--------------------------

Dependencies
---------------------

+ debian_  

  - Paella_ is meant to run on a debian system.  

  - Currently only i386 is able to be tested.

  - most of paella can run on sarge, with the exception of the kde management
    interface.

+ useless_

  - useless_ is a set of python packages that provide a common set of code 
    for python applications I write.

+ python-kde3 and python-qtext

  - only the management interface depends on these.

  - both of these should be easy to backport from sid.

  - parts of useless_ depend on this, and not paell-kde directly, but useless is split 
    to be able to use only what is needed.

I have placed backports of the needed dependencies on the website.  These 
packages should be enough to run paella on sarge.  Add these lines to your 
/etc/apt/sources.list::

	deb ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/paella/ sarge/
	deb-src ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/paella/ sarge/


-----------------------------

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

Paella_ is written for system administrators using debian_.  Ultimately it should not 
be required to learn sql or python to competently use paella, but currently this is
not the case.  The user should, however, feel quite comfortable writing simple shell 
scripts.

The traits in paella are not meant to be replacements for packages.  A local repository 
with self-made/backported packages will greatly enhance the amount of customization 
that can be performed on systems.  People using paella should be able to make simple 
packages, and upload them to their local repository using mini-dinstall or something 
equivalent.  The paella-debrepos package helps with this.

----------------------

Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain paella is through subversion::

	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless
	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk paella

Have the build-deps installed on your system, and the packages should build 
without problems.

There is a tarball_ available, but it is likely to be out of date.  There is still a lot
to do before a 1.0 release will be made.

Useless_ -- My toolkit of python code.

FAI_ -- Fully Automated Installer for debian
     Paella takes most of its inspiration from fai.

Python_ -- Except for a few shell scripts, paella is written
	entirely in python.

Postgresql_ -- High quality SQL Database Server
	    Paella uses a postgresql database.

PyGTK_ -- Graphical Tool Kit for python
       Paella uses pygtk for its graphical interface.

PyKDE_ -- Graphical Tool Kit for python
       Paella also uses pykde for its newer graphical interface.

TOra_ -- ToolKit for Oracle
      Also works very well with postgresql.  Highly recommended companion
      to the deficient gui on paella.
