todo for etch:
--------------------

- remove python2.3 from all scripts
	-----done, looks like I did this a while ago

- completely deprecate the gtk management client

- use cheetah templates

- write a script that converts old type templates to cheetah templates

- rename template files in traits (use md5sum of filepath, instead of numbered order)

  - not using md5sum of filepath, but replacing '/' with '-slash-'

  - there is no need to determine template name from filename

  - as it's in the xml, so it will be easier to see which template is which

  - in the exported version.

  - mostly done but untested

- fix environ variable tagnames in trait.xml files, make it easy to convert from old to new files
	----done, made a conversion script for it
		
- fix problems encountered with importing Packages files into the database

- get umlmachines working again

- rename template files instead of using numbers

- remove requirement that templates be matched to packages

- use trait.xml conversion script to fix template filenames on exported traits

  - decided not to do this, the export will use the new method by default

  - the import will try the new method first then revert to the old

- consider using bcfg2 for live updating of already installed machines

things done to database for testing
--------------------------------------------------

- stuff to fix later, when more code is up to date

removed kudzu, only test with sarge and desksarge
	put kudzu back in teporarily to fix missing trait problems

problems with importing Packages files into the database
	problem seems to be blank lines in description field
	workaround now is to remove those packages from the traits
	and fix the culprit later

	traits to fix when the problem is solved:
		pyca - default trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - hqgames trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - xgames trait - sarge, desksarge, kudzu

		freecraft - xgames trait - kudzu
		
		cantus - media_tools - kudzu

problems with missing traits that are present in kudzu
	 
- families
	  
 - removed admin_password variable from insecure 

 - trait webmin only in kudzu
	    
- profiles
 
 - ume_graphics only in kudzu
