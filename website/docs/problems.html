<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This page details problems with paella that are planned to be fixed at some
point in the future.  Be sure to also read the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page, as the problem you
are experiencing may be listed there.  Generally, the items on the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page
are not so much problems or bugs as they are an explanation of the behavior
of paella, what to expect, and what's required when using it.  There may be a
couple of items on the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page that could be considered problems, but I'm
not listing them here, until I can determine a good course of action to resolve
them.  I welcome input on what should be done about both the items here and on
the <a class="reference external" href="notes.html">notes</a> page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-gui-needs-more-work">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">The gui needs more work</a></h1>
<p>There are a lot of unimplemented features in the gui.  There are also features
that don't work appropriately.</p>
<div class="section" id="template-editor">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Template Editor</a></h2>
<p>The simple template editor may have problems in some desktop environments.  When
some text is selected, and you right-click the mouse, the selection may disappear.  I
have not seen this happen in a gnome or kde desktop environment, but I have experienced
this in xfce and lxde environments.  I have not yet figured out what to do about this problem.
<strong>Update</strong>  I've noticed that this mainly happens while running the paella-management
application from within virtualbox, so perhaps the bug lies there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="templates-with-in-the-filename">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Templates with &quot;%&quot; in the filename</a></h2>
<p>There seem to be problems when accessing templates that have a &quot;%&quot; character
present in the path of the template.  This problem has been noticed while trying to
modify gconf xml files.  Presumably, this problem can be easily fixed by proper
escaping of the &quot;%&quot; character, but I don't know how to do this yet, at least without an
ugly hack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="delete-trait-variables">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Delete Trait Variables</a></h2>
<p>There is currently no way to delete variables from a trait with the gui.  You will have to
use either plain sql or another database gui (like <a class="reference external" href="http://tora.sourceforge.net/">TOra</a>) to delete trait variables.  This
is not a problem when managing variables in profiles, families, or machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="machine-manager">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Machine Manager</a></h2>
<p>The machine manager is still somewhat new.  Most of the dialogs are just simple
text entry dialogs, instead of having a list to select the entry from.  More appropriate
dialogs should be added in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="schema-problems">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Schema Problems</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>templates in the traits are tied to packages <strong>fixed</strong></li>
<li>current_environment should look more like default_environment<ul>
<li>changing this will require some changes to the code.  Either the
changes will be extensive, or they will be minor, and scattered throughout
the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="circular-dependencies">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Circular Dependencies</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The traits, families, and machines all have parents, and there is
no code to check on whether there is a circular relationship among
these entities.  Fixing this problem is a low priority for me.  The
administrator who makes the paella database should be aware of
how the entities relate to each other.  If there are times when the
install or parts of the management interface seem to stall, and
there's a python process using all the cpu, this is probably the reason.
I'm open to accepting patches from people who wish to have this
problem fixed, especially since it might become more difficult to tell
that a circular dependency exists as the database grows in size and
complexity.  These problems can probably be easily fixed by using
the kjbuckets graph class that's already being used in paella.  I just
haven't gotten around to doing this, and probably won't until I start
experiencing problems here.</li>
<li>Due to the way the variables are substituted, there is also the chance
that a circular dependency can occur here.  This problem will be harder
to detect, and therefore, harder to prevent in the code.  Also, as the
database increases in size and complexity, it's more likely that a
circular dependency will happen here, rather than in the objects above.
I'm open to suggestions on how this problem can be both spotted and
fixed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="apt-sources">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Apt Sources</a></h1>
<p>The way apt sources are handled by the installer is not the very flexible.  Only the
http method is handled by paella, and for the install, all of the packages must come
from a single host.  It is probably possible to overcome this by using the hook scripts
to create the apt sources yourself, but this is still not tested.</p>
<p>Also, for every apt source listed in a suite, the installer will place both deb and
deb-src entries into the sources.list file.  In some cases this is not desirable
and you may need to make your own scripts to handle the apt sources.  You
can do this by making machine scripts for <strong>apt_sources_installer</strong> and
<strong>apt_sources_final</strong> in a machine and have all machines that need this
to depend on that machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="man-pages">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Man Pages</a></h1>
<p>There are no man pages for the scripts that are invoked in the shell.  In the past,
I've not been interested in learning yet another document format, so I haven't
bothered with man pages.</p>
<p>Recently, it's come to my attention that rst2man has been uploaded to unstable, so
there will likely be manpages created when I start building paella against squeeze.</p>
