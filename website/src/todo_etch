todo for etch:
--------------------

- remove python2.3 from all scripts
	-----done, looks like I did this a while ago

- completely deprecate the gtk management client

- use cheetah templates

- rename template files in traits (use md5sum of filepath, instead of numbered order)

- fix environ variable tagnames in trait.xml files

- fix problems encountered with importing Packages files into the database

--------

---------------------
gtk client todo
---------------------

- main manager

------


--------------------------------------------------
things done to database for testing
--------------------------------------------------

- stuff to fix later, when more code is up to date

removed kudzu, only test with sarge and desksarge

problems with importing Packages files into the database
	problem seems to be blank lines in description field
	workaround now is to remove those packages from the traits
	and fix the culprit later

	traits to fix when the problem is solved:
		pyca - default trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - hqgames trait - sarge, desksarge
		
		fcmp - xgames trait - sarge, desksarge
