<h1><a name="original-gui-design-goals">Original gui design goals</a></h1>
<p>The original goals for the gui were to provide enough of an interface to the <a class="reference" href="http://paella.berlios.de">paella</a> 
database to do simple operations needed to create traits and their components.  
Much of the gui was made without regard for new users, or users unfamiliar with 
the code or paella system.  Most of my time spent in developing paella has been focused
on the installer code, and in system design.  It can take a great deal of time in 
testing, troubleshooting problems and improving systems.  As a result, the gui is 
very minimalistic, and will not do all (although it will do most) necessary operations 
needed to make use of the database.</p>

<div class="section" id="configuration-file">
<h1><a name="configuration-file">Configuration File</a></h1>
<p>The gui uses the paellarc config files ['/etc/paellarc', '~/.paellarc'].  Most options are 
found in the management_gui section.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>management_suites</dt>
<dd>This is comma separated list of suites to manage.  There will be a
suite manager toolbar appear for each suite.</dd>
<dt>template_profile</dt>
<dd>This is the name of the profile to create other profiles from.  New profiles 
will be copies of this.</dd>
<dt>client_path</dt>
<dd>This is the path where the imports and exports of clients reside.  This is
not crucial to the operation of paella, and will be explained elsewhere.  
When it is explained, I'll provide a link to the explanation.</dd>
<dt>manager_pos</dt>
<dd>This is the position on the screen of the main management window.  
Example:  0, 480</dd>
<dt>manager_size</dt>
<dd>This is the size of the main management window..
Example: 150, 200</dd>
<dt>${suite}_pos</dt>
