<!-- introductory comment -->
<p>Paella depends on a particular type of setup to operate.  This document details how to
bootstrap that setup, starting from the bare minimum requirements.  This guide is written
with the goal of minimizing the requirement for the root account to setup the system.  The
former method of working with paella, required (possibly) extensive configuring of a local
network.  In order to effectively use paella in a &quot;production&quot; environment, where you are
actually installing machines, still requires the same type of network configuration.  It is hoped
that the method outlined here can help prepare this by using paella to generate the
configuration that paella requires.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Requirements</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="debian">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Debian</a></h2>
<p>You should be running debian to follow this quickstart procedure.  It's technically not
required, but this document will assume that your running either lenny, sid, or etch
with VirtualBox running (from backports.org or similar).  This procedure has been tested
while running sid, although lenny should work just fine.  There also shouldn't really be
any problem with using etch, save for having to have VirtualBox installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Hardware</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart routine was developed and tested using a laptop with 3GB of memory.
You could probably get by with less which I will try to estimate later.  Most of the memory
is required to run the virtual machines.  I estimate that only 2GB of ram will be required.
Please note that this is only the hardware requirements for following this quickstart
procedure, and doesn't reflect the actual requirements to run paella in a regular
environment with a network of machines.</p>
<p>You will need to run an operating system that can host VirtualBox OSE.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualbox-ose">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">VirtualBox OSE</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart will use VirtualBox OSE to setup the machine that will act as the main
paella server, and also to test to make machines to test the installs.  The procedure outlined
below is assuming that you are using a GNU/Linux system as a host for VirtualBox OSE, but
there shouldn't be anything stopping somebody from using VirtualBox  on another host OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-netinst-cd-image-lennybeta2">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Debian Netinst CD Image (LennyBeta2)</a></h2>
<p>The upcoming lenny release is what is currently supported.  You should get the netinst iso,
which available on this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">page</a>.  I used the <a class="reference external" href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/lenny_di_beta2/i386/iso-cd/debian-LennyBeta2-i386-netinst.iso">i386</a> image.  Hopefully any architecture should work,
but at the moment, only i386 is tested.  When I'm satisfied that the i386 is working properly, I'll
be testing the amd64 architecture.  Feedback on any other architectures would be appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remaster-the-netinst-iso">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Remaster the netinst iso</a></h2>
<p>This step is highly recommended.  This step is technically optional, but it may be handy,
especially if you have an application that can remaster an iso image.  This allows you to
preseed the debian installer and make an automated install.  Even though this step is
technically optional, it would be a very good idea to get the script below, and the files that
are obtained through subversion in the script to get an idea of how to proceed manually
without performing this step.</p>
<p>If you are running debian, remastering the iso is easy:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svn export svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk/config/scripts/remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p>if you already grabbed the netinst iso image, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso /path/to/debian-LennyBeta2-i386-netinst.iso
</pre>
<p>if you haven't gotten the netinst iso image yet, type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./remaster-netinst-iso
</pre>
<p><strong>WARNING!!!</strong>  This script uses sudo to perform the loopback mounting of the iso
image.  Be sure to look over the script really good before you execute it.  You may want to
change the ARCH variable near the top of the file.  Be sure that you have rsync, sudo, and
subversion installed.</p>
<p>Either download the iso, and enter the filename as the first argument, or just run the script
without arguments.  The script will download the debian-LennyBeta2-i386-netinst.iso for you.</p>
<p>The script will give you a chance to review and edit the preseed files before you create the
remastered iso image.  When the script is finished, the iso image will be ./paella-netinst.iso .</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  The preseed configuration files, and the setup scripts assume that the locale
is set to en_US.UTF-8 .  If you are using another locale, you really need to modify both the
preseed.cfg file, and the setup-paella-server script.  The postgresql database server will not
run unless your locale is generated, and referenced in the postgresql.conf file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Setup the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<p>You need to get the virtualbox frontend up and running.</p>
<p>Make a new machine using the wizard provided by the virtualbox frontend.  Press next
and name the machine &quot;paella&quot;.  Select &quot;Debian&quot; for the OS type.  Press next.  Set the base
memory size to 512MB.  Press next.  Make a new disk image at the default 8GB size (I chose
dynamically expanding size).  Press finish.</p>
<p>Select paella from the list of machines on the frontend, and click the settings button.  In the
configuration dialog, select CD/DVD-ROM on the left hand side.  Click on the Mount CD/DVD
Drive button at the top.  Select the ISO Image File.  Press the folder on the right to bring up
the Virtual Disk Manager.  Here you want to add the netinst iso that you downloaded.  Close
the Virtual Disk Manager, and make sure that the iso is selected as the image file that will
be mounted.</p>
<p>Now, select the Network part of the list of the left hand side of the settings dialog.  By default,
the network adapter should be enabled, and set to NAT.  This is what we want.  We also want
to add another network interface to this machine, so select the Adapter 1 tab.  Click the
&quot;Enable Network Adapter&quot; button.  Make sure the &quot;Attached to&quot; selection is set to &quot;Internal
Network&quot;.  You will need to name the network in the field that says &quot;Network Name&quot;.  Any name
should do just fine.  I used &quot;lapnet&quot; (no quotes), since I'm on a laptop.  Remember this name,
since you'll need this for the other machine(s) that you will use paella to install to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boot-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Boot the paella virtual machine</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="install-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Install the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>Now you should be ready to boot the virtual machine, and install debian lenny.</p>
<p>Boot the machine by pressing Start (the green arrow) on the virtualbox frontend (make sure
the paella virtual machine is the one that's selected).  When the boot screen appears, select
one of the first two menu options.  Don't bother selecting the second option unless you have
a local debian mirror, and you have modified the preseed files.</p>
<p>If you remastered the netinst iso, the install will proceed automatically.  The setup scripts
will be copied to /usr/local/bin by the debian installer.</p>
<p>If you didn't remaster the netinst file, you can find the preseed files, and the setup scripts
in the <a class="reference external" href="http://paella.berlios.de/netinst/">netinst</a> directory on the paella website.  You can just install debian in the normal
manner.  You'll need to select the standard, desktop, and database-server tasks.  Look at
the preseed file to see how the default setup is configured.  The hostname, main user, and
the main user's password are all set to &quot;paella&quot; to make it easy to remember.  The paella
user should be added to the src, staff, adm, and sudo groups, but this probably isn't
an absolute necessity.  Set the dhcp3-server to listen to eth1 on the debconf question.</p>
<p>The rest of the instructions will assume that you installed from a remastered iso.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-boot-on-the-paella-virtual-machine">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">First boot on the paella virtual machine</a></h2>
<p>After the debian installer is finished, the virtual machine should reboot .  You should take
this time to disassociate the iso image from the machine in the VirtualBox frontend, else
the iso will boot everytime you boot the virtual machine.</p>
<p>When the sytem boots up for the first time, login as paella (password paella), and type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo setup-paella-server
</pre>
<p>This should set up everything that couldn't be done on the debian installer.  This script
will setup the cofiguration of the database, firewall, dhcp server, and the network interface
for the internal network.</p>
<p>While I've tried to make things work by restarting services, things don't always work right.
You may need to reboot the virtual machine after this script, if you notice errors in restarting
the servers at the end of the execution of the script.  If you do encounter the errors, and don't
feel like rebooting, restart these services:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 restart
sudo /etc/init.d/shorewall restart
</pre>
<p>In the xorg.conf file, the screen resolution is set to 1024x768.  This is because the default
screen size for VESA is 1280x1024, which is too big for my laptop.  Feel free to edit this file,
or restore the original at /etc/X11/xorg.conf.orig .  You may also want to use the virtualbox
guest drivers, but the input drivers (mouse and keyboard) stopped working when I tried
them.  The vesa driver is known to work, even though it's probably not nearly as efficient.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to setup the development environment, and get the source code from
subversion.  to do this, type</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd
paella-devel-quick-setup
</pre>
<p>This will setup the directories, and download the source code from the berlios subversion
repository.  You'll need to either source the paella_environment file, add the lines of that file
to your .bashrc, or source the file from your .bashrc .  Since you're using a virtual machine, it
would probably be best to add it to your .bashrc</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cat paella_environment &gt;&gt; .bashrc
</pre>
<p>If you didn't remaster the iso, you can cut and paste the apt-get command from the output of
the script.  The list of packages is likely not accurate, and you really need to read the preseed
files for a reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="build-paella-packages-from-source-tree-optional">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Build paella packages from source tree (optional)</a></h2>
<p>You may wish to go ahead and build debian packages from the source tree.  If you do this, you
will also have to build the <a class="reference external" href="http://useless.berlios.de/">useless</a> packages.  Going this route has the advantage of keeping
you from having possibly modify your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-files">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Configuration files</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="setup-paellarc">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Setup .paellarc</a></h2>
<p>If you used the quick setup script above, the example paellarc file will be here,
~/workspace/paella/config/share/paellarc .  You can copy this file to ~/.paellarc and edit it.
If you are not familiar with the file format, you can read about it <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ConfigParser.html">here</a> .  Options that are
prefixed by an underscore are not referenced in the code.  You can make your own if you
wish.</p>
<p>In the database section, the dbhost option should be the ip address of the tap interface you
created in the section above.  You will probably want to change the dbusername option to
the database admin user that you created above.</p>
<p>You can either ignore or completely remove the installer section.  It is only needed for the
paella machine installer.  It is not needed for the user-mode-linux installer which we are
using here.</p>
<p>The management_gui section has options for the paella-management application.  The options
that you may want to change here are &quot;text_editor&quot;, and &quot;x_differ&quot;.  Both of these commands
should display an X window.  For the x_differ, I highly recommend xxdiff.  The x_differ command
line conform to this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
x_differ LeftFile RightFile
</pre>
<p>You should not need to change any other options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup-umlmachines-conf">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Setup .umlmachines.conf</a></h2>
<p>If you used the quick setup script above, the example umlmachines config file will be here,
~/workspace/paella/config/share/umlmachines.  If you built packages, install the
paella-uml-admin package, and you will find the file at
/usr/share/doc/paella-uml-admin/examples/umlmachines.conf .  You can copy this
file to ~/.umlmachines.conf and edit it.  The file format is the same as the paellarc file.
Reading through this file can give you a good idea of how the paella uml system works.</p>
<p>The top of the file is where most of the paths are defined.  You shouldn't have to change these
if you are using the quick setup script, although you will probably need to modify the
<strong>uml_initscript</strong> option to point to the correct location of the paella-init file.  This
is the option with the value &quot;%(_script_path)s/paella-init&quot; , and has a comment above it for
working from the source tree.  Simply uncomment this option, and comment out the option
for the default location right below it.</p>
<p>If you are not using the default tap network described above, you will have to modify the uml
network options accordingly.</p>
<p>You may want to modify the <strong>bootstrap_debmirror</strong> option in the
<cite>umlmachines</cite> section, if you already have a debian mirror that you can run
debootstrap from.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="using-paella-management">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Using paella-management</a></h1>
<p>You should be ready to use the paella-management PyKDE interface now.  Before running
the application, check the <strong>management_gui</strong> section of your ~/.paellarc file,
and make sure that both the <strong>text_editor</strong> and <strong>x_differ</strong> options
are set to applications that exist on your system and work in X windows.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-paella-management">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Start paella-management</a></h2>
<p>Run the paella-management script to start the management interface.  The first thing that you
will want to do is to connect to the database.  There is a connect button on the toolbar for you
to press.  The connection dialog entries are taken from your ~/.paellarc file.</p>
<p>Once you connect to the database, you should get a dialog asking to create the primary
tables.  You should click yes here to setup an empty database structure.  If you don't do
this, the database import procedure will create these tables for you, but you won't be able to
use the paella-management interface until you do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-stage1-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Import stage1 database</a></h2>
<p>Now we are going to import the startup database.  You will need an internet connection to
import the database.  The importer downloads the Packages files from the debian mirror in
the database.xml file, and inserts them into the database.  Go to the menubar, and in the
database menu, select &quot;import database&quot;.  A directory selection dialog will appear.  You
need to select the &quot;stage1&quot; directory.  Note that the default debian mirror is
<a class="reference external" href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian</a> .  If you need to change this, edit the database.xml file
in the stage1 directory, and alter the uri attribute to the aptsource xml element at the
top of the file.  You can change this to a local mirror if you already have one.  Paella has only
been tested with http apt sources, it's behaviour on other methods is unknown.</p>
<blockquote>
If you are working from a subversion copy from the quick setup script, the directory
you will want to select is here, ~/workspace/paella/config/share/databases/stage1/ .</blockquote>
<p>If everything is working, you should be seeing an ugly little progress dialog displaying
something resembling what it should be doing.  The packages will probably take a little
while to insert.  The apt_source_packages table can take a lot of space that could be
better saved.  In the future, it will probably default to only holding package names rather
than the other attributes in the Packages file.  The reason they are there is to help keep the
automated installations from bombing due to unavailable or misspelled packages.</p>
<p>After importing the database, you will have to disconnect and then reconnect to the
database to refresh the available widgets in the paella-management application.  You may
wish to restart the application instead, as when an import occurs, a lot of memory is used
to parse the Packages file, and insert the packages into the database.  This memory is not
freed after the import process.  Fixing this has not been a major goal, as imports are fairly
rare during the normal use of paella-management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configure-stage1-database">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Configure stage1 database</a></h2>

<p>Now we should be ready to install the uml machines.  The uml installer is currently limited to

Basically it either generates or restores the base.tgz for pbuilder.  The base.tgz is copied to

is to get the useless and paella packages built.  There is a script that does this too.
type:</p>

<p>This script will checkout the sources from subversion.  It then exports the working copies and
uses pbuilder to build the exports.  Once the packages are built, they are uploaded to
the uml_head machine, and placed in the debian mirror.</p>
