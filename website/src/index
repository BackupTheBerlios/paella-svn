What is Paella_?
---------------------

Paella_ is a installation/configuration management system centered on 
being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and 
networks.  The define, configure and install parts are working well.  The 
update and maintain portions still have yet to be realized.

Paella is not a fully extensible installer that can work in a variety of 
environments.  The debian-installer works much better for a generic
installer.  The paella installer is designed to be run from a live system 
(preferably built with DebianLive_) with access to a postgresql database, 
and a debian mirror.  It's mainly tested and used with a "net" live image, but 
it can be used from cdrom, or external usb.  It can also install a system in 
a chroot environment,  although not all the features are supported in this case.

-----------------

What is Paella_ **Not**?
-------------------------------------

Paella is not a full-fledged configuration system (yet), so far I have been mostly 
concerned with installation.  There is technically nothing preventing this.  With a good
design of traits and their scripts, it may be possible to just do a chroot reinstall on
the target system, and call it reconfigured.  The scripts in the default database are 
not written for that yet, but there is nothing in the paella framework keeping 
reconfiguration from happening with a reinstall.  In the near future, I may be looking 
into using the paella database to create a configuration that bcfg2 can use, and use 
that method to update the machines that have been installed with paella.

--------------------------

Dependencies
---------------------

+ debian_  

  - Paella_ is meant to run on a debian system.  At the moment, only debian linux is 
    supported, but the kfreebsd port may be supported in the near future.

  - Currently only i386 is able to be tested, but it should be able to run on any 
    architecture.

  - most of paella can run on lenny, with the exception fai-client, which must be 
    backported from sid.  (at the moment, even this is insufficient, and if you're
    reading this statement, you'll have to use some experimental packages from
    http://fai.alioth.debian.org/ )

+ useless_

  - useless_ is a set of python packages that provide a common set of code 
    for python applications I write.

-----------------------------

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

Paella_ is written for system administrators using debian_.  Ultimately it should not 
be required to learn sql or python to competently use paella, but currently this is
not the case.  The user should, however, feel quite comfortable writing simple shell 
scripts, and possibly some simple python scripts.  The better that the administrator 
is with coding in python, the more he/she can get out of paella.

The traits in paella are not meant to be replacements for packages.  A local repository 
with self-made/backported packages will greatly enhance the amount of customization 
that can be performed on systems.  People using paella should be able to make simple 
packages, and upload them to their local repository using reprepro or something 
equivalent.

----------------------

Download
--------------

Currently, the best way to obtain paella is through subversion::

	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/useless/trunk useless
	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/paella/trunk paella

Have the build-deps installed on your system, and the packages should build 
without problems.

There is a tarball_ available, but it is likely to be out of date.  There is still a lot
to do before a 1.0 release will be made.  Heck, there's still a lot to be done before 
I release 0.8.0 . ;)

Probably, the best way to get started using paella is to read the quickstart guide 
that's mentioned in the documentation section below.

Useless_ -- My toolkit of python code.

FAI_ -- Fully Automatic Installation for debian
     Paella takes most of its inspiration from FAI, and 
     uses FAI to setup the disks.

Python_ -- Except for a few shell scripts, paella is written
	entirely in python.

Postgresql_ -- High quality SQL Database Server
	    Paella uses a postgresql database.  Paella makes 
	    extensive use of foreign keys, and uses some plsql
	    procedures, so porting it to another database backend 
	    wouldn't be an easy task.

PyKDE_ -- Graphical Tool Kit for python
       Paella also uses pykde for its newer graphical interface.

TOra_ -- ToolKit for Oracle
      Also works very well with postgresql.  Highly recommended companion
      to the deficient gui on paella.  Even when the gui is "full featured" there 
      are still things that can be done with pure sql access that will probably 
      never be supported in the gui.
