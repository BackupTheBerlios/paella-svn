<p>[installer]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>allow_unauthenticated_packages</strong>:  This option tells apt to refrain from authenticating
the Release file from the debian mirror.  It's highly recommended that you leave this option
set to False and sign your mirrors with a key.  This option is here just in case all else fails.</li>
<li><strong>archive_keys</strong>:  This is a comma separated list of key names that paella will feed to
apt-key during installation in order to authenticate locally generated debian mirrors.  These
are the names of the keys that are stored in the apt-key manager in the paella database.</li>
<li><strong>base_log_directory</strong>&quot;:  This is full path to the directory where the log file for
the installer will be placed.</li>
<li><strong>bootstrap_target</strong>:  This option, when set to True, will call debootstrap to bootstrap
the target system.  When this option is False, the base system will be extracted from
a premade tarball.  If you extract from a premade tarball, you'll have to create a
/etc/resolv.conf file that will work early in the install process.  The code in paella may do
this for you one day, but until then, it's the responsibility of the paella database to run
the code required to build the /etc/resolv.conf (probably by copying it from the nfsroot
system).  <strong>Update</strong>:  Paella now copies the /etc/resolv.conf from the installer system
during the &quot;ready_base_for_install&quot; step.  If any of your machines have a script that
replaces this step, it may need to implement this part.</li>
<li><strong>bootstrap_suites</strong>:  This is a comma separated list of suites that will be bootstrapped,
and tarred up for later extraction.  This option is used by the paella-setup-nfsinstaller script,
and can be ignored if you use your own method to make the tarballs.  <strong>Note</strong>:  The
paella-setup-nfsinstaller script may not work and shouldn't be used.</li>
<li><strong>default_target</strong>:  This is the target directory where the system will be installed.  If
this isn't set, /tmp/target will be used.</li>
<li><strong>devices_tarball</strong>:  This option provides the location of the devices tarball on the installer.
This tarball is created with &quot;MAKEDEV generic&quot;, and the resulting device nodes are tarred
up for extraction later.  This is done as a time saver, since the MAKEDEV script can take
a good bit of time to run.  This option will be kept around in case it needs to be used, but
it's not being used anymore, since much of the device creation is done by the udev program.</li>
<li><strong>disk_log_directory</strong>:  This is the directory where the files that setup-storage creates
will be placed.  Usually this is a subdirectory of the base_log_directory.  The full path to
the directory needs to be specified.</li>
<li><strong>http_mirror</strong>:  This is the url to the debian mirror that will be used to install the target
system.  This is probably a bad name for the variable, and it is likely to be deprecated in
the future (once I figure out a better name).</li>
<li><strong>keep_installed_packages</strong>:  This option, when set to True, will keep the downloaded
packages in /var/cache/apt/archives .  When the option is False, the packages will be
deleted at the end of each trait process.</li>
<li><strong>trait_processes</strong>:  This option determines the processes that will be run for each
trait during the install process.  This can be useful if you only want to install the packages
and skip the installation of templates, packages, or skip the running of scripts during the
install process.  Since this is a default option, any machine being installed will follow this
behaviour, so this is mostly useful for testing and maintainence purposes.  Eventually,
the trait processes may be set on a per machine, profile, or even trait level, allowing more
control over the installation of specific machines.  The default processes are:  pre, preseed,
remove, install, templates, config, chroot, reconfig, and post.</li>
<li><strong>suite_storage</strong>:  This option provides the location of the debootstrapped suite tarballs.
The tarballs provide a convenient way of speeding the installation without having to have the
installer run debootstrap for each install.</li>
<li><strong>use_devices_tarball</strong>:  This option is meaningless now, but in case it isn't, it should
be set to False.  The udev package (and kernels) have improved a lot since sarge, and
this option may never have to be used again.</li>

<div class="section" id="machines-section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Machines Section</a></h2>
<p>[machines]</p>
<p>All the options in this section are of the form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
hwaddr_11_22_33_44_55_66:     machinename
</pre>
<p>The option is and encoded representation of a mac address, and the value is
the name of a machine.  The paella installer uses this section to figure out
which machine to install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="auto-install-section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Auto Install Section</a></h2>
<p>[autoinstall]</p>
<p>All the options in this section are of the form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
machinename:   True (or False)
</pre>
<p>Once the paella installer identifies the machine from the entry in the
machines section, it uses the autoinstall section to decide whether to
install or not.  You can always install the machine manually by typing
(as root):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paella-machine-installer install machinename /tmp/target
</pre>
<p>I've historically used /tmp/target as the target directory since the paella
installer used to run from a read-only nfs mount.  With debianlive this
is not necessary anymore.</p>
