general todo
---------------------------------

+ use cheetah templates

  - started

  - all cheetah templates will have ##cheetah on the first line

- write a script that converts old type templates to cheetah templates

  - there is a function that does the conversion from the database

    - the conversion automatically wraps the file with #raw directive

    - "\$" and "\#" had to be escaped if they were present in the original template

+ rename template files in traits (use md5sum of filepath, instead of numbered order)

  - not using md5sum of filepath, but replacing '/' with '-slash-'

  - there is no need to determine template name from filename

  - as it's in the xml, so it will be easier to see which template is which

  - in the exported version.

  - mostly done but untested

+ fix problems encountered with importing Packages files into the database

  - there is a workaround that seems to be working for now

+ get umlmachines working again

  - started

+ rename template files instead of using numbers

+ remove requirement that templates be matched to packages
	-----done, I should've done this much, much sooner

+ use trait.xml conversion script to fix template filenames on exported traits

  - decided not to do this, the export will use the new method by default

  - the import will try the new method first then revert to the old

+ consider using bcfg2 for live updating of already installed machines

+ remove python2.3 from all scripts
	-----done, looks like I did this a while ago

+ completely deprecate the gtk management client
	----done, the kde manager does most of what gtk manager did

+ fix environ variable tagnames in trait.xml files, make it easy to convert from old to new files
	----done, made a conversion script for it

+ clean up unused options from paellarc file, look for options to move into default 
  environment in database.
