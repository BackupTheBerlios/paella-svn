What is Paella_?
---------------------

Paella_ is a installation/configuration management system centered on 
being able to easily define, configure, maintain and update systems and 
networks.

-----------------

Dependencies
--------------------

+ debian_  (Paella_ is meant to run on a debian system.  Currently only i386
  is able to be tested.)

  - most of paella can run on sarge, with the exception of the kde management
    interface.

+ useless_

  - useless_ is a set of python packages that provide a common set of code 
    for python applications I write.

+ python-kde3 and python-qtext

  - only the management interface depends on these.

  - both of these should be easy to backport from sid.

  - parts of useless_ depend on this, and not paell-kde directly, but useless is split 
    to be able to use only what is needed.

-----------------------------

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

Paella_ is written for system administrators using debian_.  Ultimately it should not 
be required to learn sql or python to competently use paella, but currently this is
not the case.  The user should, however, feel quite comfortable writing simple shell 
scripts.

The traits in paella are not meant to be replacements for packages.  A local repository 
with self-made/backported packages will greatly enhance the amount of customization 
that can be performed on systems.  People using paella should be able to make simple 
packages, and upload them to their local repository using mini-dinstall or something 
equivalent.  The paella-debrepos package helps with this.

Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain paella is through subversion.
